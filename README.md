# Open-Condition-Monitoring

What is Open Condition Monitoring?
==================================

OCM (Open Condition Monitoring) is a required part of a systematic method of defining tasks. Where it is known that changes in certain parameters indicate a mode change, such as from operating normally to failing.  

Initially OCM is open sourcing the Maintenance Techniques and Analysis overview :

[Open Condition Monitoring, MTA](MaintenanceTechniquesAnalysis/MaintenanceTechniquesAnalysis.html "Maintenance Review Techniques Over View")


It is envisaged that OCM will enable secure storage by common means to provide infrastructure to provide facility  for investigation and institution of anonymous analysis of data. The wider statistical significance of access to larger data sets would engender more useful and flexible reporting systems.  

There is a requirement for secure anonymous data transfer from sensors, presentation, organisation and analysis of the data.  

Cryptographic currency "Blockchain technology" could be an ideal open technology backbone to exploit to enable rapid development of an enhanced system. The encrypted nature of the data, peer to peer (P2P) transfer, Blockchain ledger and p2pool would enable a distributed network.  

This gives the opportunity for cooperative effort whilst retaining personal data anonymity, if so designed.  

Various levels of co-operation or running your own instance of OCM would be possible. For smaller users, services could be provided, I.e. the use of ASICs to secure a network, with optionally a payment method. Small users would just attach to common network, their analysis server (or service) would decrypt readings from the Blockchain as a wallet does for cryptographic currency. High risk data could be secured by multi-signature cryptography (before being anonymised).  

The blockchain would probably require features as described in PBA (Private Blockchain Addresses).  

https://github.com/wrapperband/PrivateBlockchainAddress  

Such a system where the number of users is more limited and other secure layer can be added above the Blockchain more easily as a data register. Although use of cryptographic technology automatically adds security layers, for instance secure backups of the sensor readings via multiple instances of the Blockchain and cryptographically securing those backups so the can't be tampered with.  

## Open Condition Monitoring & Open Forums.  

Whilst governmental systems claim to be representative there is usually no formal channel of expression of grass roots opinion in most system, representatives garner views or assume their view is representative after being voted in. Whereas in software development and most industries and companies internet forums have been important in building communities to discuss and develop policy and functionality, no such forum has developed in the real world.  

This maybe because a forum without information is just an echo chamber, i.e. other facilities are required to make the general population have the interest to contribute to the discussion.  

OCM is envisaged, and has been based on, work done to provide tools to monitor mechanical machinery. However, it can also include work on the more complex monitoring of human health, and less complex but more unpredictable, monitoring of commercial enterprises.
In particular close monitoring of government related tasks and budgets, with suitable analysis to show a wide range of considerations.  

The synergy of A.I. techniques to normalise and fuse data from available sources, say by agents. Such a system might highlight that a trend is due to a particular external cause, no one had thought of, which changed the attitude to worrying trends.

The core principle of sharing meta data are particularly relevant to health data and stands of such analysis. A grass roots discussion of how that should be done would aide its inception and agile development of health monitoring standards beyond the individual.  

By developing the tools behind open forums as open source, it would encourage rapid development over many areas where there is currently a vacuum.  


## Monitoring the human survival system


Human survival depends on a suitable environment. The population needs to be as cleaver and informed in order to act against any real dangers. In the past ideas could be tested in the environment, in that was so large it could recover, or at least stabilise, even if at the disadvantage of other species.

The current idea is that open condition monitoring could facilitate the invention and distribution of citizen monitoring sensors, develop distributed storage via block chain and help produce compile reports on Github. It could also look to see how data could be imported from other sources. 

Monitoring parameters is fine but it is also important that these are attached to decisions, maintenance or policies so they can be calibrated to indicate what is happening in the real world. 

### Initial Tasks : 

#### Identify Modes of success

e.g.  Amount of parks available to each personal

#### Identify Modes of failure

e.g. Amount of parks area per mile per person should be above X (50%?)


#### Identify monitorable parameters

There are ways to proceed, generate the required known problems. This will entail citizen data collection, this can be just hosting a sensor. Additionally, use available data and attach this to monitor causes of failure, proportionally to it's applicability. 

e.g. Possible  parameters   Proportion of fat in food sold, Proportion of sugar in food sold, Noise levels, Pollutants, sunlight obscured, Pot holes, Government maintenance back logs, visits to government websites, polls on the subject

#### Identifying new trends or issues

It can be seen there is a possibility to have parameters designed to raise, or prioritise new issues, as well as monitor old ones for deterioration.

#### Data storage structure and relevance

Potential data structure 

Open Condition Monitoring   
    Global Concerns (Global, Environmental, Governmental, Resources)   
     Regional Concerns (Environment, Supply, Energy, Assets, Skills, Regional Infrastructure)   
      Local Concerns  (Employment, Energy, Environment, Skills, Local Infrastructure)   
       Assets (Buildings, Structure, Equipment, Devices, Personnel)   
        Methods (RCM, FTA, FMEA, FMECA, FSA, Information)   
         Parameters (CM, NDT, History, Events, Data)   
          Syndromes (Trends, Ways ahead, Theories, Conclusions)   
       
#### Alternatives to sensors methods of data collection

Some monitoring parameter would be possible using the "population". For instance relying on institutional statistics such as crime rates for the police is automatically biased. Relying on the opinion of the public is also easily biased by the media.

It would be possible have a "app" people could use and report all of the incidence type they've experienced. It is strictly not efficient use of time and possible privacy hazard to a lot of people.

However, it is possible to envisage a probabilistic method where a large number of volunteers are sampled (to a tested error rate)  on  a regular basis, on wither the feel they've experienced a crime? Or had a car accident in last week or such, thus acquiring use-full data to compare with institutional statistics.

This means some data can be collected in advance of of open hard ware or sensor systems being developed and distributed.

It would be advantageous for political parties to sponsor information collation to gain addition information of the success of policies. For instance, the amounts of certain types of specific complaints or observations sent to MPs could be specifically counted. Note that the total number of correspondence to MPs may also indicate problems.

#### Methods of automating sensor data collection using Machine Learning

An example of how machine learning can be used to set up a large array of citizen sensors might be the effect of aircraft condensation trails or cloud cover. A complex issue to distinguish normally.

Volunteers would have a cheap USB camera set to view any open & fixed section of the sky. An robot system such as http://openbiometrics.org/docs/install/  Poppy, could be used to view the camera and log features such a brightness.

This can be done by pre-training "face recognition" and "robot control" and loging the results as a trend. 

The robot is trained with 2 cameras initially. The robot has control of the brightness of one camera and is trained to duplicate the automatic brightness control in the other. That trained "brain" can then be applied on the sensor site where it be allowed to improve it's fine control of that environment. The logged adjustments to brightness can be trended and give a measure of the cloud cover.

It would be then possible to use other machine learning techniques to automatically monitor particular issues. For instance cloud cover, or sky brightness could be data fused with an aircraft events in the area. i.e. give a report or trend that would show if there is any correlation, the amount and the error.

The ability of the system to be trained to distinguish between plane trails and clouds gives another advantage. It could give a guesstimate of brightness change due to aeroplanes. In that case by assisted learning with a large number of tests measured for proportion. It seems probable that a climate system will soon be developed which recognises types of cloud, which could be extended with extra training to record the proportion of plane con trails.

The system could then be retrained and used, say, to detect traffic levels or other issues, and use face recognition to detect type and direction, use the robot ability to store trend-able data.

The new "smart motorway" sections have collected over £1M in speeding fines this year. 
On one section of the M1 in Nottinghamshire, police issued 8,489 tickets, amounting to £425,000 of fines in 2015. (2014 was £0)
They have variable limits so may introduce instability into the driver habit forming process experience.

The extra info I'd be interested in (some available now probably, some possibly discoverable, some we would have to look for future potential e.g. cell phone data:

E.g. Location, direction of travel, Time of day, traffic density, ratio of local to non-local or foreign drivers, ratio of HGV to cars, male or female, age, car type, journey type, whether mobile phones in use.


## Quality of Life Monitoring

### Oldham Test case

It is clear that historical information can be mined to show previous trends for areas of interests. That analysis task is complex, but informative. It is also an ongoing task that needs care and integrity, an ideal ongoing experimental / monitoring / analysis for students.

### Types of material available to analyse

Identification of available parameters is important but not exclusive step. The viability and ease of collection needs to be noted as well as it's veracity. Each parameter might be an indicator of many types of mode of failure, so would be worth doing more analysis or developing new sensor methods.

It is important to create possible tasks from the causes of failure, even though those task may be impossible of expensive currently. In the future it will be possible to use data fusion to infer more complex parameters at specific locations by fusing other sensor data (say from a similar environment) to produce a phantom reading of a certain accuracy. This could be used when considering actions, such as allowing a property extension or other development, what effect that has on pollution to the current occupants. The power of this should be plain, identification of pollution, or other problem, hot spots, that are currently damaging a few peoples health very badly, instead of just ignoring all dangers.

### Technology

What technology can be leveraged to  enable Open Condition Monitoring?

#### Blockchain

Blockchain technology can be re-purposed to enable a distributed system. Proof of Work and or Proof of storage could be used to secure the data and reward the Transaction completion with "sensor" credits to the system. This means the public could contribute simply by storing, or being a node to the blockchain(s).


Public blockchain allows for a mechanism of anonymous data sharing. An example would be Open Condition Monitoring being used to anonymously and securely monitor equipment at a disabled persons house. In addition to identifying a faulty fridge, the system could also use common data to diagnose the fault.

Notes : The type of adjustment to blockchain code needed to use for sensor data retention and analysis.

Change transaction trigger to include data size. The difficulty set for mining or encoding a transaction would include a size limit, such that as transaction is filled.

The difficulty for the next transaction would then be calculated on a suitable short time, such that as soon as a transaction is full it is available to mine.

#### P2Pool mining pools



### Open condition monitoring Case studies

#### Example projects suggestions

##### Chemical Trails from Aircraft

It is clear from other projects and research that there could be at least two explainations for chemical trails. The fist obvious one is that (sub) standard fuel is being used  that causes the pollution. Another explaination is that fuel additives or spraying are being used to effect the climate.

The third explaination is that Psy-operation to cover the effects Condensation Trails on weather and sun / Vitimin D levels on humans living close to aircraft activity.


**Measurable parameters**

Aircraft height  - Any aircraft that appears to forming a Condensation trail bellow 30 thousand feet
  By using a gun sight to measure the length of the aircraft and the angle to the aircraft, allows monitoring height. Combined with a photo long term proof and Con / chem trail size estimation. 


Length of Trails
  Take a photo (long term proof) and Con / chem trail size estimation.

Air Pollution levels correlated to plane activity

### OTIC and currently available parameters

Currently available parameters can be assessed and tested for relevance to policy or issue. A Task is created to asses what is the "correct" or "expected" level of the parameter with regard to that problem. For instance, pollution reduction could be the policy, the tasks would be to monitor pollution and set appropriate geographic distribution, find if reading is being taken, set appropriate status, alarm, concern, warning, danger. Then the regularity of measurement (or observation for analysis) is set initially on time to "vary".
Appropriate thining or data fusion techniques also need to be developed as unlike machine maintenance there is more risk in not acting.

See Ref : Examples of available parameters

For example http://www.gaugemap.co.uk/  shows the levels at various rivers in the UK. In OCM those readings would be linked to policy, for instance over development of hilly terrain removing soak or other factors like "global warming".

### Case Studys 


#### Aims of the Labour Party

In order to analyse the significance of various possible factors to promote the Labour Party, it is important to identify the aims, or Mode of Success of the organisation or Process. For the Labour Party 

Clause IV.: Aims and values (of the Labour Party)

"The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few, where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe, and where we live together, freely, in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect."

#### Investigative powers bill 

Analysis of the petition response for the Investigative powers bill. In particular, the issues, ie "a review" to repeal it, that all considerations had been covered. As in 9/11, that did not seem to be the case as MPs being forced to vote against their will or other actions were not considered, like long term safety of the Public if their were a dictatorial coop...

If the safety of public was considered, what is the predicted average increase in danger to the public? and how can we measure if that is effective long term? what are the warning and alarm levels for further action?
