    In British industry, the maintenance plan has often evolved rather than being
    consciously set-up resulting in an over reliance on breakdown and fixed time
    maintenance (planned maintenance). Historically plant equipment has been
    robust and less automated than modern equipment making it relatively easy
    to work on. These plants have relied on large and expensive maintenance
    departments to enable rapid attention to breakdowns. Single-line single-product
    plants with no standbys have allowed profitability to be increased through
    the economies of scale. On the downside, this has resulted in ever increasing
    breakdown costs. In this changing environment, historical maintenance plans
    cannot provide the required level of plant performance.

</H3>
<P>
The goal of any well run maintenance organisation is to have the lowest cost
of the sum of two quantities, i.e.:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Maintenance labour and material: and
  <LI>
    Production loss (which includes lack of ability to produce, and value added
    material that is lost as a result of a break down) reduction resulting from
    an inadequate maintenance program.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Maintenance itself can result in excessive downtime and costs. This results
from the requirement to take the machinery off-line to carry out (possibly
unnecessary &amp; invasive) maintenance. The danger of infant mortality after
it has been put back on line again and also the cost of the maintenance action
itself contributes to costs. Achieving the lowest cost is an optimisation
technique shown graphically in Figure 1.

Companies should be able to put a cost to their loss of production resulting
from equipment down time. This figure added to the maintenance budget results
in the total costs as shown. When maintenance costs are at a minimum the
cost of lost production is at its highest. As maintenance effort and costs
are intelligently increased the production loss gradually decreases until
the lowest combined cost is achieved. This is the maintenance goal. Maintenance
effort applied beyond this point, <I>increases costs. </I>Maintenance can
increase costs because of the need to take equipment off line to carry out
maintenance, infant mortality after being put back in service, etc. There
are also the costs of the maintenance itself with labour and material costs.

<I>Terotechnology: </I>a combination of management, financial, engineering
and other practices applied to physical assets in pursuit of economic life
cycle costs. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) involves collecting all the cost
information incurred during plant life. This information will show the

for cost reduction.

Decisions made at an early stage in the concept and design of an item of
plant can have significant effects on the cost of running that piece of equipment
throughout its life (Figure 2).
<P>
<I>Preliminary design review</I> - 15% to 35% of the life cycle costs have
been determined
<P>
<I>Concept design review</I> - 25% to 40% of the life cycle costs have been
determined
<P>
<I>Critical design review</I> - 95% of the life cycle costs have been determined.
<P>
The designer must be aware of the consequences of his decisions. If for instance,
he installs a bearing in an inaccessible position, that bearing will certainly
have to be changed a number of times during the life time of the equipment.
Due to the difficulty of access this will incur excessive costs. If this
inaccessible position is unavoidable, the installing of a top quality and/or
an oversize bearing, will increase the purchase costs but may reduce the
overall life cycle cost. The same applies during the operating life in the
purchasing of spare parts, maintenance tools, and training of operators and
maintainers. A saying sums this up "buy cheap-buy twice". Terotechnology
recognises that attention to maintenance alone will not provide the complete
answer to the problems arising in the maintenance sector (or otherwise attributed
to maintenance). It is necessary to look at other management functions having
an influence on the performance and costs of physical assets. Figure 4 shows
the contributors to the total life cycle costs.

systems and communication channels which provide support for maintenance.
Typical contributions include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Design - assets designed for maintainability and reliability
  <LI>
    Procurement - application of 'best buy' procurement techniques
  <LI>
    Projects - provision of assets having operability and maintainability features
  <LI>
    Operations - introduction of operating techniques which reduce downtime and
    improve care of assets
  <LI>
    Finance - cost control, cost monitoring and feedback
  <LI>
    Personnel - selection and training programmes for operating and maintenance

A reliable piece of mechanical equipment is understood to be basically sound,
to be able to meet its design specifications, and to give trouble-free
performance in a given environment. However, it is necessary to have an
understanding of the technical, engineering use of the term 'reliability'
as specified for mechanical equipment. All plant, equipment and components
have a finite life, and so eventually all pieces of equipment will fail.
Without a technical definition of reliability it would not be possible for
engineers or managers to make meaningful comparisons between the reliability
of alternative plant and equipment.

</H3>
<P>
Reliability is the probability that a plant or component will not fail to
perform within specified limits in a given time while working in a stated
environment. For the case of mechanical systems the following definition
can be used to define reliability
<P>
Mechanical Reliability is the <I>probability</I> that a <I>spare,</I>
<I>item</I>, or <I>unit</I> will perform its prescribed <I>duty</I> without
<I>failure</I> for a given <I>time</I> when <I>operated</I> <I>correctly</I>
in a <I>specified environment.</I>
<P>
The definition of reliability includes a number of variables that are external
to the artefact being analysed. Identical equipments may have very different
duty requirements such as frequent stop-starts or continuous running.
Environmental conditions such as fine dust can also effect a machine. It
is thus necessary to understand completely the operating conditions under
which an artefact is expected to operate.
<H3>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493934">3.2.2. Maintainability</A>
</H3>
<P>
Once a piece of equipment has failed it must be possible to get it back into
an operating condition as soon as possible, this is known as maintainability.
To calculate the maintainability or Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of an item,
the time required to perform each anticipated repair task must be weighted
(multiplied) by the relative frequency with which that task must be performed
(e.g. no. of times per year). MTTR data supplied by manufacturers will be
purely repair time which will assume the fault is correctly identified and
the required spares and personnel are available. The MTTR to the user will
include the logistic delay as shown in Figure 5.

  Availability</A>
</H3>
<P>
The probability that an item, under the combined influence of its reliability,
maintainability and maintenance support, will be able to fulfil its required
function over a stated period of time, or at a given point in time. The operating
context of a piece of equipment will determine its performance requirements.
An airliner will be expected to reach its destination once it has taken off.
To guarantee this it will spend a relatively large amount of its time being
serviced. In this case the reliability must be 100% but it's availability
may be relatively low. In process industries which run continuously the
availability is of prime importance. The definition of availability is:
<P>
The availability of a system is the probability that the system is functioning
at time <I>t.</I> The Availability for a single machine is:
<P>
A = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR)
<P>
The implication of this formula is that high availability can be obtained
either by increasing the MTBF, and hence the reliability, or improving the
maintainability by decreasing the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). The MTTR would
include the repair time and the logistic delay (obtaining labour and spares).
<H3>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493936">3.2.4. Repairable &amp; Non Repairable Systems</A>
</H3>
<P>
In reliability engineering repairable and non repairable systems are treated
differently. A non repairable item is replaced with a new item which will
be as good as the item replaced. Over time as items are replaced with identical
new items the failure rate will remain constant. In a repairable system the
repaired item following a breakdown will not be as good as when it was first
installed (as good as new (agan)) General wear and errors in the repair carried
out will result in the failure rate increasing over time.

Up to now the reliability of individual spares has been discussed. A number
of spares will make up an item which in turn make up a unit, plant area,
and then an entire plant. In industry it is necessary to estimate the
reliabilities of equipments that interact with each other. Before any form
of reliability analysis is attempted, it is necessary to represent the system
under consideration, as a block diagram. A block diagram with an individual
block for each unit can represent the entire plant. If necessary lower level
block diagrams can represent items within units. Two basic types of diagrams
can be used to represent a system.
<P>
A functional block diagram (system layout) can represent the actual plant
layout showing how plant units are interconnected. This helps to describe
how the system is expected to operate.
<P>
For reliability assessment a Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is more useful.

Many differing batches of mechanical and electrical industrial components
have been tested to determine if it is possible to predict when they will
fail. These tests have revealed that during their normal working life, they
do not reach a point of wear-out at some likely time that could be called
"old age". On the contrary a given item is as likely to fail in a given week
shortly after installation as in a given week many months later. This probability
of failure which is known as the failure rate (symbolised by the Greek letter
lamba ) can go through three distinct failure patterns. Batches of components
can display one, two or all three (Figure 9 Bath Curve) of these patterns
(stages) through their life time.

In the first of the three stages, the failure rate plunges downward rapidly
from a very high starting point - this is "infant mortality". Failure during
this stage can be attributed almost entirely to manufacturing &amp; installation
defects. Failure caused by manufacturing defects or poor installation tend
to show up almost immediately, accounting for the high starting point. The
term "Burn In" which can also be used to describe this period, comes from
the computer industry where new machines are run in a hot environment before
dispatch. Any hardware faults will show up quickly in this elevated temperature.
Once a machine passes it shall have a long trouble-free life. Equipment can
also return to the infant mortality stage after maintenance intervention
(Figure 10). For various reasons, equipment can suffer problems as a result
of maintenance. Planned maintenance can actually reduce its availability.
<P>
Example: a group of similar bearings are changed every year as part of a
planned maintenance activity. If they were condition monitored and changed
on showing signs of imminent failure, it would be found that these bearings
have an average life of 2.5 years. This over maintaining then results in
increased probability of failure due to the infant mortality after each
maintenance activity.

As the curve levels off, it enters the second stage that is a straight segment
indicating an essentially constant failure rate. In the final stage, the
failure rate climbs sharply as spares wearout.
<P>
In reality the bath curve has little application in industrial process. Very
simple components can follow this failure pattern such as a light bulb where
faulty manufacture may result in very short life. A rare example of a more
complex system that follows the bath curve is a petrol engine. Engines have
to be taken care of in their early life to allow them to "bed in". Following
this they go through a period of constant failure. Most petrol engines then
fail following a life of 100,000 to 150,000 miles. Even this so called wearout
period can cover a significant part of the engine's life.

During the development of the Boeing 747, batches of aircraft components
were tested to determine their failure patterns
(ref.<A NAME="_Ref402592199"></A>). The results are displayed in Figure 11.
<P>
<I>Pattern A</I> is the well-known bath curve.
<P>
<I>Pattern B</I> shows constant or slowly increasing failure probability
ending in a wear-out zone.
<P>
<I>Pattern C</I> shows slowly increasing probability of failure, but there
is no identifiable wear-out age.
<P>
<I>Pattern D</I> shows low failure probability when the item is new or just
out of shop, then a rapid increase to a constant level.

Pattern E shows a constant probability of failure at all ages (random failure).
<P>
<I>Pattern F</I> starts with high infant mortality, which drops eventually
to a constant or very slowly increasing failure probability.
<P>
In highly complex equipment, such as an aircraft, infant mortality followed
by random failure is the dominating failure pattern as shown by the above
studies carried out on civil aircraft. Within manufacturing industry,
approximately 30% of industrial failures are related to age as in A &amp;
B. With increasing complexity of modern equipment the failure pattern from
industry will more closely match the studies from the aircraft industry.

Failure pattern B depicts age-related failures as in the figures from the
aircraft industry very few failures show a relation-ship with age. An example
would be abrasion, e.g. the abrasive action of piston rings on the cylinder
walls of a reciprocating engine.
<P>
Failure pattern C shows a steadily increasing probability of failure, but
there is no one point at which we can say, "that's where it wears out". Cyclic
stresses resulting in fatigue are the main cause of this failure pattern.
<P>
Failure Pattern E is pure random failure. All the empirical evidence shows
that rolling element bearings usually conform to a random failure pattern.
However it is still possible to compute a mean time between failure (MTBF)
for such items. It is given as the point at which 63% of the items have failed.
Often poor MTBF for bearings can be attributed to poor choice and/or fitting.

Failure pattern F is the most common failure pattern and like the bath curve
shows a failure rate decreasing with age before going into a period of random
failure. The high infant mortality has a variety of causes:

poor design bad workmanship

incorrect installation poor reassemble

Some engineers and managers tend to be over optimistic about the effectiveness
of Planned Maintenance (PM). There are limitations to PM:
<UL>
  <LI>
    the limitations set by random failure events. Random machinery failure events,
    according to their definition, could occur with equal probability in time.
    Identical components could be as likely to fail after 1 week as 5 years after
    installation. In effect, they are always as good as new. There is no period
    of time after which it would be effective to change these components.
  <LI>
    the life dispersion of machinery components. Even time dependent failures
    are not all that predictable. They do not appear after absolutely equal operating
    intervals, but after very dissimilar time periods (Figure 12). This dispersion
    increases as the MTBF increases.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The example below (failure distribution A) shows the occurrence of MTBF for
a compressor bearing:
<P>
10 bearings failed between 2.5 years and 3.5 years.
<P>
20 bearings failed between 3.5 years and 4.5 years, etc.
<P>
From 3.25 years the incident of bearing failure started to increase
<P>
By 5.5 years 50% of the bearings had failed
<P>
Some bearings did not fail until 8.5 years
<P>
Imagine a strategy of changing all the bearings at 4.7 years.
<P>
The frequency of failure had started to increase over a year earlier and
some bearings would continue to run satisfactorily for another 3.7 years.
Even though this planned maintenance is 0.8 years before the average life
of 5.5 years, a considerable number of failures still occur (area a + b).
<P>
This planned maintenance is expensive in that it changes the majority of
bearings needlessly early (up to 3.7 years early) and it does not prevent
failures as a small amount still occurs.
<P>
Planned maintenance for failure distribution "B" in which the majority of
failures occur in the period 4.3 years to 7 years would be more effective.
A PM strategy at 4.7 years would allow a small number of failures (area b).
It again takes place 0.8 years before the average and 2 years before the
maximum expected life. While in this case it is more suitable for PM than
distribution "A", it still incurs costs due to early maintenance. Distribution
A type curves would be more usual in industry than distribution B. For failure
distribution "B" and possibly "A" Condition Based Maintenance would be suitable.

Once equipment has been purchased it must be maintained. The decisions made
at the purchasing will have an input into the type of maintenance to be carried
out. Maintenance actions can be divided into four general categories or
strategies as shown in Figure 13. The maintenance plan for a company's assets

</H3>
<P>
Planned maintenance is the most widely used form of maintenance. It is most
effective if implemented as equipment begins to wearout and failure probability
increases. Planned maintenance tasks are often grouped together into maintenance
downtimes or windows to minimise the total number of planned maintenance
stoppages per year. This strategy is seriously flawed because the majority
of industrial failure modes are random in nature and so maintenance tasks
based on time will have limited effected in improving equipment performance.

</H3>
<P>
CBM relies on the fact that the majority of failures do not occur instantaneously
but develop over a period of time (P-F Curve). CBM involves recording some
measurement that gives an indication of machine condition (temperature increase
on an insulation surface, vibration increase on a bearing housing). Condition
monitoring is not purely a <I><B>'high tech'</B></I> tool to be used by highly
skilled engineers. From the early days of steam trains "wheel tappers" used
a hammer to strike a wheel to listen for the distinctive "ring" that said
the wheel is healthy and without cracks. Operators who work with equipment
every day can listen to equipment and identify changes in noise levels and
vibrations. Temperature changes can be felt and these give warnings that
something is 'not right'. An investigation can then be carried out to identify
the exact problem.

This can prove to be a very effective method of solving a recurring problem.
However it can easily be inappropriately utilised. Putting in a more powerful
motor due to frequent tripping may be an ill-thought out reaction to malpractice
by an operator, whilst simple instruction may solve the same problem. Before
considering designing out a problem, it is important to identify exactly
what the root cause of the problem is. Having identified the root cause;
is it possible to monitor the condition at this problem area? If so, it may
be cost effective to monitor the condition and take action as necessary.
If this is not the case; can the problem be designed out? If it can; what
will this involve and can it have any adverse effects elsewhere? Once the
procedure has been thoroughly developed, proceed with the design out project.
Finally if design out is been considered, is it a symptom that mistakes were
made during the original designing of the equipment?

This in not actually a maintenance strategy but a combination of fixed time
(planned maintenance) and breakdown maintenance. It can be useful when a
forced stoppage gives maintenance unexpected access to machinery to carry
out inspections and/or maintenance. Inspections during routine down times
can identify unexpected tasks that need to be carried out but time does not
allow it to happen. These tasks can be recorded on a maintenance management
system and scheduled into the first available down time.

</H2>
<P>
With a growing awareness of the random nature of many failures, condition
monitoring techniques are becoming more popular. Modern condition based
maintenance practices like vibration analysis rely on the fact that many
failures do not occur instantaneously, but actually develop over a period
of time. If evidence can be found that this failure process is under way,
it may be possible to take action to prevent failure and/or avoid the
consequences. At the early stages of failure it is not possible to detect
the signs of an impending failure. As the failure develops, there comes a
point at which it can be measured. At this stage the failure has not yet
reached a stage in which the equipment is unable to operate effectively.
However the maintenance department has now the opportunity to correct the
fault, before it becomes more serious. The point in the failing process at
which it is possible to detect that the failure is occurring or is about
to occur is known as a <I>potential failure</I> (potential because a serious
failure has not yet occurred). Examples include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    hot spots on bearing housings and in electrical panels.
  <LI>
    vibrations indicating imminent bearing failure
  <LI>
    particles in gearbox oil showing imminent gear failure
  <LI>
    visible leaks and wear.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The P-F curve (Figure 14) shows how a failure starts, deteriorates to the
point at which it can be detected (the potential failure point "P"), if it
is not detected and corrected, continues to deteriorate - usually at an
accelerating rate - until it reaches the point of functional failure ('F')
The P-F interval can be known as the "Lead Time To Failure."

The "condition" being measured can take a variety of forms. Any condition
that shows a change, as the health of the spare deteriorates, can be used.
It must however, give enough of a warning between "P" and "F" to allow actions
to take place otherwise nothing will be gained by having a warning. Equipment
condition being measured could include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    reducing pressure supplied by a pump indicating impeller wear, slip ring
    wear, etc.
  <LI>
    increased surface temperature on the outside of an insulating surface indicating
    insulation deteriorating
  <LI>
    increased vibration from rotating equipment; these vibrations must be analysed
    further to identify possible causes.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Having identified point P then two actions can take place:
<P>
<I>to prevent the functional failure</I>. Depending on the nature of the
failure mechanism, it is sometimes possible to intervene to repair the existing
component before it fails completely.
<P>
<I>to avoid the consequences of the failure.</I> In most cases, detecting
a potential failure does not actually prevent the spare from failing, but
still makes it possible to avoid or reduce the consequences of the failure.
For example the necessary spares, personnel and equipment could be made
available, or the effected part could be changed out of production time before
it actually fails.

<P>
The life of a component and the P-F curve are often confused. On-condition
task frequencies are often based on the real or imagined "life" of the item.
If it exists at all, this life is usually many times greater than the P-F
interval, so the task achieves little or nothing. The component life is measured
forward from the moment it enters service. On the other hand the P-F interval
is measured back from the functional failure to some point that a warning
of the forthcoming function failure can be detected (potential failure).
The two concepts are often unrelated.

In the above example (Figure 15), the batch of components has a random failure
pattern with two failures in the first year. Let us assume that over a large
batch these components have an average life of 3 years. From condition monitoring
it has been observed that these components have a P-F interval of about 4
months. Because they started to fail in the first year of service the condition
monitoring tasks must commence immediately after installation on a 2 monthly
basis. The timing of the inspections has nothing to do with the age or life
of the component.
<P>
P-F curves can have considerable variation in length from minutes to months.
A P-F curve of 4 months is desired because:

    fewer on-condition inspections are required

    it is possible to do whatever is necessary to avoid the consequences of the

Earlier it was shown that due to the randomness of many failure modes, planned
maintenance (based on time elapsed, machine running time, machine cycles,
etc.) will have limited effected on improving the performance machinery.
Often it can actually make it worse. In many situations it can prove cost
effective to measure the condition of the equipment and plan maintenance
as required. This is known as condition based maintenance (CBM).
<H3>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493956">12.2. Operating Parameters</A>
</H3>
<P>
How best to monitor machine or bearing condition requires one to know which
measurements to take and where and how to take them. Commonly measured operating
parameters include:
<H3>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493957">12.2.1. Vibration</A>
</H3>
<P>
In rolling element bearings, vibration results from the impact generated
by a ball rolling over a defect. Methods such as Shock Pulse and Spike Energy
are used to detect bearing damage. Vibration measurements taken and trended
over time can be a good indication of bearing damage. Vibration is the best
operating parameter to judge rotating machinery conditions such as balance,
alignment, bearing stability, and stress applied to components. Measuring
the overall vibration of a machine; a rotor in relation to a machine; or
the structure of a machine, and comparing the measurement to its normal value
(baseline reading) and alarm setpoints, indicates the current health of the
machine.
<H3>
  12.2.2. <A NAME="_Toc404493958">Temperature</A>
</H3>
<P>
Temperature measurement (Thermograph) is a useful indicator of electrical
or mechanical condition such as the load applied to a thrust bearing. As
a bearing fails, friction causes its temperature to rise. The use of infrared
cameras or installing thermocouple sensors in the housing of a bearing and
measuring temperature changes within the bearing or lubricant allows problems
to be recognised early (potential failure).
<H3>
  12.2.3. <A NAME="_Toc404493959">Lubricating Oil Analysis</A>
</H3>
<P>
Monitoring oil condition warns of an increase in foreign substances, such
as water, (&gt;2.5%) which can degrade the lubricating properties of the
oil and cause bearing failures. It also detects the presence of metallic
particles carried into the oil stream. These metallic particles are analysed
to determine which part of the machine is wearing and how fast. Particle
Counting and Ferrograph are two analysis techniques.
<H3>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493960">12.2.4. Acoustics</A>
</H3>
<P>
Very high frequency, acoustically transmitted vibration is measured with
a high frequency piezoelectric sensor. This sensor is excited by compression
waves produced by metal-to-metal contact and by metal as it mechanically
fails. The acoustic flow detection signal is conditioned to produce outputs
which can be measured as numerical values on a meter. These measurements
are used to judge the overall condition of a bearing and evaluate local defects.
This technique is highly effective in very early detection of bearing failure.
<H3>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493961">12.2.5. The Human Senses</A>
</H3>
<P>
The simplest condition monitoring techniques are the four human senses (look,
listen, feel, and smell)
<P>
Machinery faults such as:
<UL>
  <LI>
    visible wear on slides.
  <LI>
    vibration levels from rotating equipment
  <LI>
    damage on conveyor belts, drive belts.
  <LI>
    tension adjustment on belts, drive chains.
  <LI>
    oil, water levels.
  <LI>
    pressure and other types of gauges can be monitored
  <LI>
    heat build-up on bearing housings refractory linings, etc.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
They are not as accurate as the more scientific methods but still have
considerable advantages:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A human being is versatile and can detect a wide variety of failure conditions,
    (an infrared camera can only detect heat)
  <LI>
    Operators are always near the equipment so if a P-F curve is very short,
    an operator can check specified measurement points many times a shift if
    necessary. The only alternative in the case of very short P-F curves is highly
    expensive on-line monitoring equipment.
</UL>
<P>
Many of these monitoring tasks are ideal for operators due to their close
proximity to equipment. Skilled maintenance engineers may not be always available
to carry out these tasks and would prefer to be doing more highly skilled
jobs.

</H4>
<P>
Different machinery problems cause different types of vibration. For example,
a bent shaft causes a machine to vibrate differently to a worn bearing.
Generally, these differences are indistinguishable to the touch or ear. However,
with sensors and micro-processors, some condition monitoring equipment coverts'
vibration data into various plotted formats that are recorded and analysed
to help diagnose machinery problems. Vibration analysis is the analysis of
these plotted vibration signals to diagnose the cause(s) of abnormal vibration.
Popular vibration analysis formats include overall vibration trend plots,
time waveforms, spectra analysis and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
<H2>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493965">13.2. CBM Tours</A>
</H2>
<P>
Condition Based Maintenance utilising vibration analysis involves setting
up "tours" (a list of condition based maintenance tasks to be carried out).
One particular tour may take place every two months. The measurements taken
on this tour can be recorded using a data collector and trended in a maintenance
management package with automatic alarm signals if increases in vibration
signatures are recorded. The vibration measurement at each measurement point
will vary dependent on the type of failure mode being trended.
<H2>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493966">13.3. Overall Vibration</A>
</H2>
<P>
Overall vibration measures the total energy associated with all vibration
frequencies coming from a given measurement point. Overall vibration values
are compared to past vibration measurements taken when the machine was in
good running order.
<H2>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493967">13.4. Fast Fourier Transform</A>
</H2>
<P>
Because different types of problems often occur at different frequencies
it is very useful to analyse measured vibration signals with respect to
frequency. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can mathematically breakdown
the overall vibration signal and arrange it according to frequency. The amount
of vibration occurring at any particular frequency is called the <I>amplitude
</I>of vibration at that frequency. FFT analysis can be very useful when
analysing the causes of vibration. Vibration associated with say a bent shaft
or impeller problem will occur with the frequency of rotation of the shaft.
Problems associated with the roller bearings will occur at higher frequencies
that are a function of the number of rollers in a bearing.
<H2>
  <A NAME="_Toc404493968">13.5. Failure Modes</A>
</H2>
<P>
A selection of common detectable failure modes are:
<P>
<I>Imbalance:</I> a peak at shaft speed.
<P>
<I>Misalignment</I>: typically 1x, 2x &amp; 3x shaft speed
<P>
<I>Looseness</I>: often at 1x or 2x shaft speed
<P>
<I>Bearing Damage</I>: higher frequency peaks typically between 2 KHz and
5 KHz depending on shaft speed and transducer resonance.
<P>
<I>Electrical Problems</I>: synchronous frequency and side bands.
<P>
<I>Gear Damage</I>: gear mesh frequency depending on shaft speed and number
of teeth and side bands.
<P>
<I>Oil Whirl</I>: approximately half shaft speed.
<P>
<I>Blade Damage</I>: number of blades by shaft speed.
<P>
<I>Cracked Shaft</I>: typically 2x, 3x shaft speed.

Most organisations use, hundreds, if not thousands of physical assets. The
assets range in size from small pumps to steel rolling mills. They may be
concentrated on one small site, or spread over thousands of square kilometres.
The number and variety of items means that it is necessary to draw up a
comprehensive list of these assets for maintenance purposes, spares purchasing,
or accounting exercises. In maintaining equipment it must be possibly to
identify individual spares and the effect of their failure on the total plant
This list is known as the plant register The plant register is a listing
of the plant, equipment and buildings owned or used by the organisation,
which can require maintenance of any sort. In establishing a plant register
a structured <I>(or hierarchical) </I>approach to asset definition is required.
<H3>

</H3>
<P>
Five terms must be defined
<P>
Spares (&amp; Measurement Points), Item, Unit, Area &amp; Plant
<P>
<B>Spare: </B>This is the lowest inventory level and is where the spare parts
are found. Examples include, seals and bearings. All maintenance actions
are carried out at the spare level. When a gearbox fails it will be gears,
bearings, seals or shafts that will fail. Vibration analysis assesses the
condition of individual bearings. In recording maintenance tasks, they must
be attributed to a spare. This enables historical analysis to be carried
out in an FMEA and problem areas on machines can be identified from their
Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).
<P>
<B>Mpoint &amp; Parameter</B> In many cases, an FMEA will lead to routing
condition monitoring tasks. These tasks can vary from a machine operator
checking the fluid level in a site glass to specialist contractors carrying
out crack detection tests on turbines. Regardless of what type of inspection
is being carried out, some parameter is being measured. For this parameter
a pass and fail standard must exist for comparison purposes. For some parameters
such as vibration the positioning of the test probe is critical for continuity
of measurement. In these cases a measurement point (Mpoint) will be specified.
<P>
<B>Item: </B>An item is a collection of spare parts, For example a gearbox
may consist of shafts, bearings and seals. Often items can be replaced -
a gearbox or motor can be exchanged for another item to carry out the same
task.
<P>
<B>Unit: </B>A number of items may be grouped together to perform a specific
function. A motor, gearbox, belt &amp; rollers, together with a frame will
build up to form a belt conveyor.
<P>
<B>Area: </B>A number of units such as conveyors, weighing machines and packaging
machines will build up to form an area of plant that performs a specific
function, i.e. packing area.
<P>
<B>Plant: </B>A number of areas will make up an entire plant e.g. ingredient
mixing area, ovens, cooling area, and packaging area. Often a plant will
be a single cost centre.
<P>
Creating an asset hierarchy is a time consuming and complex task. This can
be highlighted by the case of a water pump.
<P>
A main water pump in a hydro-electric station would be an area on its own
because three levels would be required below the pump level to describe all
of the valves and hydraulic control gear needed to control the water flow.
<P>
In industry most motor/pumping units with associated valves and switch gear
would be considered as a unit. The motor and pump would be considered as
items.
<P>
A motor/pump unit in a central heating system would not be serviced. In the
hierarchy it could be treated as a spare.
<P>
Creating classifications may not be a simple task. In industry the hierarchy
may be based on stages of the process. In building services the classification
may be based on location. Problems can arise when both may be applicable
but they conflict.

FMEA &amp; FMECA (Ref. ) are engineering analysis that, if performed properly,
can be of great value in assisting the decision making process of the engineer
during the design stage or maintenance review to analysis possible and existing
modes of failures of a piece of equipment. The analysis is often called a
'bottom up' analysis as it examines equipment at the spare level, and considers
the system failures that result from their different failure modes. In an
FMECA analysis a relative criticality is calculated for each failure mode.

A maintenance review can be carried out using an FMECA approach to identify
potential failure modes. This is done by gathering the maintenance records
of the plant. Accurately recorded data obviously aids the production of an
optimised maintenance plan. It is here that the benefit of associating all
maintenance tasks to a particular spare becomes crucial to an accurate review.
The findings from the FMECA are then tabulated in the form of a work sheet.
A FMECA worksheet with typical columns is shown in Figure 18.

<P>
Fault Tree Analysis can be a very detailed process and is used in the analysis
of complex systems. It complements FMECA in that it is a "top-down" analysis,
starting with a system fault (the top event) and analysing this fault in
terms of sub-system faults. For example in the nuclear industry the top event
could be a leak of radio-active water from a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger
is then analysed to identify every possible way it could leak such as a leaking
flange or cracked pipe. Each sub event is then analysed to identify how each
one could occur, such as incorrect flange packing fitted, incorrect flange
pressure, excessive water pressure, etc. One of the next levels would then
be to identify all possible reasons for a pressure build up inside the heat
exchanger pipes. The process is complete when every possible root cause of
a water leak form the heat exchanger has been identified. Each event can
have a probability associated to it. The same techniques as used in the chapter
on Reliability Block Diagrams can then be used to estimate the probability
of a radio-active leak form the heat exchanger.
<P>
<B>Example</B>
<P>
In Figure 19 the top event is no liquid display on a calculator. This can
be caused either because the LCD has failed, or because there is no power
reaching the display. The latter fault is analysed further, and may be caused
by the faults shown, either switch failed at off, or internal wiring failure,
or no power to the calculator.
<P>
In this example the secondary basic events of:
<P>
Multiple failure of LCD's
<P>
Battery uncharged
<P>
No battery
<P>
will not be investigated because it does not really matter why the battery
is uncharged or why the battery is missing.
<P>
The secondary basic events of:
<P>
Internal wiring or joint failure in the calculator
<P>
Wiring or joint failure in transformer could be investigated if desired.
However it may be easier to replace the transformer or calculator than try
to fix them.
<P>
Fault trees utilise many different symbols, some similar to digital electronics
e.g. AND gates (in which all of the inputs must occur together for the event
to operate) &amp; OR Gates (in which only one of the events must occur for
the event to operate).

Fish bone diagrams are another graphical method of listing causes of an event.
"The Top Event" is shown at the end of a horizontal line on the right of
the diagram. The major categories of possible causes are arranged as branches
slanting off above and below this line. Typical causes of the top event include
the four "M's" - man, methods, materials, and machines. Specific possible
causes become the detailed twigs as shown in Figure 19.
<P>
<I><B>Maintenance Practices &amp; Procedures</B></I>
<P>
Poor workmanship (<I>man</I>) can result in some of the errors such as
misalignment. Errors such as impeller balance may result from material
(<I>materials</I>) build up on the impeller.
<P>
<I><B>Equipment Design</B></I>
<P>
The basic design of the machine (<I>machine</I>) may be deficient such as
a seal design will not protect the lubricating oil from water contamination.
<P>
<I><B>Operating Practices</B></I>
<P>
The system design may cause errors such as cavation. Inappropriate operating
procedures (<I>methods</I>) such as frequent stop starts may result in early
machine failure.
<P>
The fish bone diagram helps to focus one's mind on the possible causes of
equipment failure. Maintenance should look to cure the cause and not the
symptoms of the problem. For this reason causes should be pushed as far back
as possible. Each possible cause must then be analysed using techniques such
as FMECA to analyse the exact cause of failure.

RCM grew from studies carried out during the development of the Boeing 747
(Ref. <A NAME="_Ref403966908"></A>). This work showed that the failure modes
of aircraft components are random dominated. At this time aircraft maintenance
was based predominately on flying hours, therefore, a new method of maintaining
aircraft was considered appropriate. The RCM approach assumes no prior knowledge
of the components, a so-called <I><B>zero-based</B></I> or <I><B>first
principles</B></I> approach. Each component in the aircraft was systematically
analysed to identify their failure modes and appropriate maintenance tasks
were then assigned. This analysis is carried out by asking seven questions
about each asset.

<P>
Functions are categorised as follows:

<I>On Line Functions</I> that are in use continuously or at such frequency
that personnel will be continuously aware of their state.

<P>
<B>2 In what ways does it fail to fulfil its functions (failure mode)?</B>
<P>
The failure modes to be considered are:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Failures that have previously occurred on the equipment or similar machines.
  <LI>
    Possible failures that have not occurred before but could have serious
    consequences.
  <LI>
    Failure modes for which preventive maintenance has already been applied in

<B>3 What causes each failure?</B>
<P>
Each potential failure must be investigated to identify every possible cause.

RCM can be implemented through the setting up of cross-section review groups
who will work through the above 'seven questions' to develop the maintenance
requirements for specified assets. The zero-based approach necessitates a
high degree of understanding of the asset being analysed. If the necessary
skills do not exist within the company external specialists may be invited
to join the group to discuss specific problem areas. Each review group will
be chaired by a facilitator who will control the flow of information, ensuring
it is recorded on specific RCM worksheets. The group will work together to
answer the first four of the 'seven questions'. The RCM Information Worksheets
are used to record the answers to these questions:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Function of the asset
  <LI>
    Functional failure
  <LI>
    Failure mode
  <LI>
    Failure effect
</UL>
<P>
The next stage of RCM considers the final three of the 'seven questions'
to evaluate the consequences of the failures and based on the consequences,
identify appropriated maintenance tasks. The RCM Decision Tree is used in
this task. The output from the groups will be RCM Decision Worksheets detailing:

The introduction of a comprehensive preventive maintenance program based
on a thorough review of the operation and maintenance of the plant is essential
to achieve competitive production. An effective method of carrying out a
maintenance review is to use as a base line the experience of the plant that
has been built into the existing maintenance program and maintenance history
rather than the 'zero-based' approach of Reliability Centred Maintenance
(RCM). To carry out an effective review, it must be carried out in two stages:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ <A HREF="#_Toc404045794">Maintenance Optimisation Index</A>

</H3>
<P>
A structured analysis of plant criticality (in terms of downtime, safety,
quality etc.) is performed through the use of Reliability Block Diagram modelling
of the process derived from process flow diagrams This results in a prioritised
list of equipment for targeting in the next stage.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;[ <A HREF="#_Toc404045794">Maintenance Optimisation Index</A>
  ]
</H3>
<P>
The optimum maintenance tasks for the targeted equipment are derived through
a failure mode orientated (FMECA) review of existing maintenance programs
and history. The FMECA can be carried out by reviewing the plant maintenance
history and speaking to plant production and maintenance personnel using
techniques such as Why-Why analysis (5 Whys).

</H3>
<P>
This process will lead to specified maintenance tasks for each failure mode
identified. The selected maintenance strategies for the individual modes
of failure will in general comprise, Design-out, Condition Monitoring, Fixed
Time (planned) Maintenance, and Opportunity Maintenance. Some items may also
be allowed to run to failure. In assembling the plan for the plant, maintenance
resources and production windows will have a major influence on the maintenance
program for the whole plant. The process of assembling the plan will inevitably
involve change in strategies and interactive approach to obtain the optimum
balance between ideal maintenance strategy, production constraints and
maintenance resources. Figure 21 graphically represents the procedure for
carrying out a review of equipment maintenance (REM).

Many companies will contain information about historical plant performance
in a variety of sources such as maintenance records and production records.
This information can be useful in identifying the significant failure modes
within the plant which can then be targeted by revised maintenance tasks.
The targeting of these failure modes will realise the maximum improvement
in plant performance for the least expenditure. However in many companies
the paper based or computerised records will not contain the required detail
to enable the significant failure modes to be identified. MMSs and daily
production records may also record the same problem but it may be difficult
to collate them together for various reasons.

<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    Production personnel are often not technically minded and may put the warning
    effect down as the cause of failure, which may bare no resemblance to the
    engineers' description of the same failure.
  <LI>
    The location of the failure may vary considerably. Production operators may
    use different descriptions for machinery from the maintenance department.
    The warning effect, as described by the production operators may occur in
    a different location to the actual mode of failure as described by the
    maintenance department.
  <LI>
    One department may be deliberately incorrectly describing a problem in-order
    to pass the blame to the other department.
  <LI>
    Some breakdowns, for example product blockages, may not require the assistance
    of an engineer. Operators may accept these problems as the norm and therefore
    not adequately record the details of the delay.
</OL>
<P>
<P>
For these reasons it is vitally important to analyse fully the available
maintenance records. By asking why, four or five times the interviewee may
be moved from using the warning effect as the mode of failure to describing
the mode of failure itself.

In the following example, fourteen biscuits are collated by the counting
machine and then presented to the flow wrapper to be wrapped. The pack collator
then arranges three packs of fourteen biscuits together to be passed to the
cartoning machine which puts the three packs into a carton.
<P>
<B>Why</B> was the carton forming machine rejecting so many packs of cakes
due to short pack counts in multipacks?
<P>
Poor performance by the collator results in it being unable to count and
collate the required number of packs to be fed into the cartoner.
<P>
<B>Why</B> was the smart feeder unable to collate the packs correctly?
<P>
The collator has difficulty in counting packs due to pack length variation.
Broken biscuits along with poor quality seals results in contamination of
the drive conveyors.
<P>
<B>Why</B> are the packs varying in length, and why are the seals of poor
quality?
<P>
Poorly arranged packs of biscuits by the counting machine are been being
crushed by the cross seals of the flow wrapper resulting in contaminated
jaws and poor seals. Operators adjust the pack length to stop this happening.
<P>
<B>Why</B> are the packs of biscuits poorly arranged?
<P>
The cakes are held loosely because there are short cake counts in the packs.
<P>
<B>Why</B> is there short cake counts in the packs?
<P>
Because of various problems in the counting machine, cakes are being dropped.
<P>
In order to stop the carton former rejecting packs of cakes due to short
pack counts in multipacks, it is necessary to concentrate the maintenance
actions on a machine upstream of the cartoning machine. A review of the
performance of the counting machine recommended a range of actions to improve
its performance.

Maintaining equipment involves the collection of large amounts of information
to record historical equipment performance, identify spares, etc. Historically
this information has been held in paper based records. Large amounts of paper
based records can become difficult and expensive to store and analyse, errors
and omissions can then easily take place. The development of the Personnel
Computer has been followed by an increasing choice of computerised Maintenance
Management Systems (MMS) which replaced the paper based records. MMS should perform functions such as:

For maintenance management purposes it may be desirable to graphically represent
historical maintenance data. This type of data can be represented on histograms,
pie-charts, etc. Another way of presenting data is to carry out a Pareto
Analysis. This tool can be applied to a wide range of maintenance control
problems, for example, to highlight the relative importance of particular
key plant registers to the total maintenance effort on a line. The following
histogram shows the maintenance man-hours recorded against units numbers
1 to 30 in a 12 month period.

The Pareto analysis shows that unit numbers 23, 1, 15, 23, 18, 14, 28, 6,
13, 17, 2 &amp; 4 have incurred the majority of the maintenance man-hours.
The maximum benefit would be gained if these 12 units were targeted to reduce
their maintenance requirement.
