### <span id="anchor-3"></span>1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \] 

-   In British industry, the maintenance plan has often evolved rather
    than being consciously set-up resulting in an over reliance on
    breakdown and fixed time maintenance (planned maintenance).
    Historically plant equipment has been robust and less automated than
    modern equipment making it relatively easy to work on. These plants
    have relied on large and expensive maintenance departments to enable
    rapid attention to breakdowns. Single-line single-product plants
    with no standbys have allowed profitability to be increased through
    the economies of scale. On the downside, this has resulted in ever
    increasing breakdown costs. In this changing environment, historical
    maintenance plans cannot provide the required level of
    plant performance.

### <span id="anchor-4"></span>1.1. Maintenance Goal            \[ [Maintenance Objectives Index](#_Toc404048855) \] 

The goal of any well run maintenance organisation is to have the lowest
cost of the sum of two quantities, i.e.:

-   Maintenance labour and material: and
-   Production loss (which includes lack of ability to produce, and
    value added material that is lost as a result of a break down)
    reduction resulting from an inadequate maintenance program.

Maintenance itself can result in excessive downtime and costs. This
results from the requirement to take the machinery off-line to carry out
(possibly unnecessary & invasive) maintenance. The danger of infant
mortality after it has been put back on line again and also the cost of
the maintenance action itself contributes to costs. Achieving the lowest
cost is an optimisation technique shown graphically in Figure 1.

<span id="anchor-5"></span>**Figure 1 Maintenance Goal**        \[
[Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[ [Maintenance Objectives
Index](#_Toc404048855) \]

Companies should be able to put a cost to their loss of production
resulting from equipment down time. This figure added to the maintenance
budget results in the total costs as shown. When maintenance costs are
at a minimum the cost of lost production is at its highest. As
maintenance effort and costs are intelligently increased the production
loss gradually decreases until the lowest combined cost is achieved.
This is the maintenance goal. Maintenance effort applied beyond this
point, *increases costs. *Maintenance can increase costs because of the
need to take equipment off line to carry out maintenance, infant
mortality after being put back in service, etc. There are also the costs
of the maintenance itself with labour and material costs.

### <span id="anchor-6"></span>2. Terotechnology    \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]  \[ [Maintenance Objectives Index](#_Toc404048855) \] 

**Definition**

*Terotechnology: *a combination of management, financial, engineering
and other practices applied to physical assets in pursuit of economic
life cycle costs. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) involves collecting all the
cost information incurred during plant life. This information will show
the inter-related cost areas (Figure 3) and give an indication of their
importance for cost reduction.

<span id="anchor-7"></span>**Top  -       Figure 2 Life Cycle Costing at
Design Review Stages**  \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]\
<span id="anchor-8"></span><span id="anchor-7"></span>**Top  -      
Figure 2 Life Cycle Costing at Design Review Stages**  \[ [Table of
Figures](#TableFigures) \]\
**Bottom  - Figure 3 Contribributers to Life Cycle Costs**     \[ [Table
of Figures](#TableFigures) \]

Decisions made at an early stage in the concept and design of an item of
plant can have significant effects on the cost of running that piece of
equipment throughout its life (Figure 2).

*Preliminary design review* - 15% to 35% of the life cycle costs have
been determined

*Concept design review* - 25% to 40% of the life cycle costs have been
determined

*Critical design review* - 95% of the life cycle costs have been
determined.

The designer must be aware of the consequences of his decisions. If for
instance, he installs a bearing in an inaccessible position, that
bearing will certainly have to be changed a number of times during the
life time of the equipment. Due to the difficulty of access this will
incur excessive costs. If this inaccessible position is unavoidable, the
installing of a top quality and/or an oversize bearing, will increase
the purchase costs but may reduce the overall life cycle cost. The same
applies during the operating life in the purchasing of spare parts,
maintenance tools, and training of operators and maintainers. A saying
sums this up "buy cheap-buy twice". Terotechnology recognises that
attention to maintenance alone will not provide the complete answer to
the problems arising in the maintenance sector (or otherwise attributed
to maintenance). It is necessary to look at other management functions
having an influence on the performance and costs of physical assets.
Figure 4 shows the contributors to the total life cycle costs.

<span id="anchor-9"></span>**Figure 4 The Terotechnology system**      
\[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]    \[ [Maintenance Objectives
Index](#_Toc404048855) \]

The Terotechnology system is generally shown as a combination of
management systems and communication channels which provide support for
maintenance. Typical contributions include:

-   Design - assets designed for maintainability and reliability
-   Procurement - application of 'best buy' procurement techniques
-   Projects - provision of assets having operability and
    maintainability features
-   Operations - introduction of operating techniques which reduce
    downtime and improve care of assets
-   Finance - cost control, cost monitoring and feedback
-   Personnel - selection and training programmes for operating and
    maintenance personnel

### <span id="anchor-11"></span>3. Reliability of Systems, Equipment and Components 

### <span id="anchor-12"></span>3.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

A reliable piece of mechanical equipment is understood to be basically
sound, to be able to meet its design specifications, and to give
trouble-free performance in a given environment. However, it is
necessary to have an understanding of the technical, engineering use of
the term 'reliability' as specified for mechanical equipment. All plant,
equipment and components have a finite life, and so eventually all
pieces of equipment will fail. Without a technical definition of
reliability it would not be possible for engineers or managers to make
meaningful comparisons between the reliability of alternative plant and
equipment.

<span id="anchor-13"></span>3.2. Definitions   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="anchor-14"></span>3.2.1. Reliability 

Reliability is the probability that a plant or component will not fail
to perform within specified limits in a given time while working in a
stated environment. For the case of mechanical systems the following
definition can be used to define reliability

Mechanical Reliability is the *probability* that a *spare,* *item*, or
*unit* will perform its prescribed *duty* without *failure* for a given
*time* when *operated* *correctly* in a *specified environment.*

The definition of reliability includes a number of variables that are
external to the artefact being analysed. Identical equipments may have
very different duty requirements such as frequent stop-starts or
continuous running. Environmental conditions such as fine dust can also
effect a machine. It is thus necessary to understand completely the
operating conditions under which an artefact is expected to operate.

### <span id="anchor-15"></span>3.2.2. Maintainability 

Once a piece of equipment has failed it must be possible to get it back
into an operating condition as soon as possible, this is known as
maintainability. To calculate the maintainability or Mean Time To Repair
(MTTR) of an item, the time required to perform each anticipated repair
task must be weighted (multiplied) by the relative frequency with which
that task must be performed (e.g. no. of times per year). MTTR data
supplied by manufacturers will be purely repair time which will assume
the fault is correctly identified and the required spares and personnel
are available. The MTTR to the user will include the logistic delay as
shown in Figure 5.

<span id="anchor-16"></span>**Figure 5 Difference between MTTR and total
downtime     **  \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[ [Failure
Theory Index](#Section2) \]

### <span id="anchor-17"></span><span id="anchor-18"></span><span id="anchor-17"></span><span id="anchor-19"></span><span id="anchor-17"></span><span id="anchor-18"></span><span id="anchor-17"></span>3.2.3. Availability 

The probability that an item, under the combined influence of its
reliability, maintainability and maintenance support, will be able to
fulfil its required function over a stated period of time, or at a given
point in time. The operating context of a piece of equipment will
determine its performance requirements. An airliner will be expected to
reach its destination once it has taken off. To guarantee this it will
spend a relatively large amount of its time being serviced. In this case
the reliability must be 100% but it's availability may be relatively
low. In process industries which run continuously the availability is of
prime importance. The definition of availability is:

The availability of a system is the probability that the system is
functioning at time *t.* The Availability for a single machine is:

A = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR)

The implication of this formula is that high availability can be
obtained either by increasing the MTBF, and hence the reliability, or
improving the maintainability by decreasing the Mean Time To Repair
(MTTR). The MTTR would include the repair time and the logistic delay
(obtaining labour and spares).

### <span id="anchor-20"></span>3.2.4. Repairable & Non Repairable Systems 

In reliability engineering repairable and non repairable systems are
treated differently. A non repairable item is replaced with a new item
which will be as good as the item replaced. Over time as items are
replaced with identical new items the failure rate will remain constant.
In a repairable system the repaired item following a breakdown will not
be as good as when it was first installed (as good as new (agan))
General wear and errors in the repair carried out will result in the
failure rate increasing over time.

### <span id="anchor-21"></span>3.3. Reliability Function   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

Some batches of components can display a constant failure rate
Alternatively some items can contain many spares of varying failure
rates. With the mixing of failure rates of new and old spares within the
unit the failure rate of the unit can be constant (known as a
'pseudo-constant' failure rate. In these situations:

R*(t)* = e-*t*

R*(t) *= Reliability at time *t*

= 1/MTBF

and so

R*(t)* = e -*t*/MTBF

Where: *t* = time since the last failure

MTBF = Mean time between failures

**Example**

A motor is required to run for two years without a failure

Manufactures MTBF 2 years

= e-2/2 = 0.36

MTBF 2 years R*(t)* = 0.36 Approx. two in three chance that it will fail
in\
the first two years. The manufacturers guarantee of a MTBF of 2 years is
not\
adequate to give a high probability of survival for two years.

Manufactures MTBF 10 years

= e-2/10 = 0.82

MTBF 10 years R(t) = 0.82 82% chance that it will run for two years
without failing

### <span id="anchor-31"></span>4.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

Up to now the reliability of individual spares has been discussed. A
number of spares will make up an item which in turn make up a unit,
plant area, and then an entire plant. In industry it is necessary to
estimate the reliabilities of equipments that interact with each other.
Before any form of reliability analysis is attempted, it is necessary to
represent the system under consideration, as a block diagram. A block
diagram with an individual block for each unit can represent the entire
plant. If necessary lower level block diagrams can represent items
within units. Two basic types of diagrams can be used to represent a
system.

A functional block diagram (system layout) can represent the actual
plant layout showing how plant units are interconnected. This helps to
describe how the system is expected to operate.

For reliability assessment a Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is more
useful.

System Configurations 

It is necessary to have an understanding of the basic types of unit
layout that exist in industry

**Series Systems: **In a series system, failure of any unit constitutes
system failure. The reliability of the system is the product of the
reliabilities of the units making up the system.

<span id="anchor-38"></span>**Figure 6 Series Reliability Diagram**  
    \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[ [Failure Theory
Index](#Section2) \]

        <span id="anchor-39"></span>        **A                  B      
             C**

Placing units in series increases the failure rate and reduces the
overall availability of the system (Figure 6)

system = A + B + C

Avsystem = AvA x AvB x AvC

**Full Active Redundancy: **In an active redundancy system (Figure
7Figure 7), a number of units sustain the function until one fails; the
remaining unit can continue to provide the function.

*Note: *If both of the pumps in Figure 7 must be operational to sustain
the function, in reliability terms they would be in series despite being
in parallel on the system diagram.

<span id="anchor-40"></span>**Figure 7 Active Redundancy**           \[
[Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[ [Failure Theory
Index](#Section2) \]

The System Reliability Rs for one out of two units in parallel is:

Rs = 1-{(1-RA)(1-RB)}

**M-out-of-N **In these cases individual units share provision of the
function, which can be sustained at a satisfactory level should one or
more of the units fail. In active and standby redundancy systems this
can be known as m-out-of-n models. In Figure 8, at least m units out of
a total of n must be in operation for the system to operate.

<span id="anchor-41"></span>**Figure 8 M-out-of-N System**           \[
[Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[ [Failure Theory
Index](#Section2) \]

Example:

Three units are in active parallel, of which at least 2 must be in
operation for satisfactory system operation.

System Reliability Rs = R1R2R3 + R1F2F3 + R2F1F3 + R3F1F2

If R1 = R2 = R3

Then RS = R3 + 3RF2

### <span id="anchor-42"></span>5. <span id="anchor-43"></span><span id="anchor-42"></span>5. The "Bath Curve"      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

Many differing batches of mechanical and electrical industrial
components have been tested to determine if it is possible to predict
when they will fail. These tests have revealed that during their normal
working life, they do not reach a point of wear-out at some likely time
that could be called "old age". On the contrary a given item is as
likely to fail in a given week shortly after installation as in a given
week many months later. This probability of failure which is known as
the failure rate (symbolised by the Greek letter lamba ) can go through
three distinct failure patterns. Batches of components can display one,
two or all three (Figure 9 Bath Curve) of these patterns (stages)
through their life time.

<span id="anchor-44"></span>**Figure 9 Bath Curve**            \[ [Table
of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \]

In the first of the three stages, the failure rate plunges downward
rapidly from a very high starting point - this is "infant mortality".
Failure during this stage can be attributed almost entirely to
manufacturing & installation defects. Failure caused by manufacturing
defects or poor installation tend to show up almost immediately,
accounting for the high starting point. The term "Burn In" which can
also be used to describe this period, comes from the computer industry
where new machines are run in a hot environment before dispatch. Any
hardware faults will show up quickly in this elevated temperature. Once
a machine passes it shall have a long trouble-free life. Equipment can
also return to the infant mortality stage after maintenance intervention
(Figure 10). For various reasons, equipment can suffer problems as a
result of maintenance. Planned maintenance can actually reduce its
availability.

Example: a group of similar bearings are changed every year as part of a
planned maintenance activity. If they were condition monitored and
changed on showing signs of imminent failure, it would be found that
these bearings have an average life of 2.5 years. This over maintaining
then results in increased probability of failure due to the infant
mortality after each maintenance activity.

<span id="anchor-45"></span>**Figure 10 Average life and planned
maintenance intervals**    \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]   \[
[Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \]

As the curve levels off, it enters the second stage that is a straight
segment indicating an essentially constant failure rate. In the final
stage, the failure rate climbs sharply as spares wearout.

In reality the bath curve has little application in industrial process.
Very simple components can follow this failure pattern such as a light
bulb where faulty manufacture may result in very short life. A rare
example of a more complex system that follows the bath curve is a petrol
engine. Engines have to be taken care of in their early life to allow
them to "bed in". Following this they go through a period of constant
failure. Most petrol engines then fail following a life of 100,000 to
150,000 miles. Even this so called wearout period can cover a
significant part of the engine's life.

### <span id="anchor-46"></span>6. Six Patterns of Failure      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

<span id="anchor-47"></span>**Figure 11 Six patterns of failure**     
\[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]

During the development of the Boeing 747, batches of aircraft components
were tested to determine their failure patterns (ref.<span
id="anchor-48"></span>During the development of the Boeing 747, batches
of aircraft components were tested to determine their failure patterns
(ref.). The results are displayed in Figure 11.

*Pattern A* is the well-known bath curve.

*Pattern B* shows constant or slowly increasing failure probability
ending in a wear-out zone.

*Pattern C* shows slowly increasing probability of failure, but there is
no identifiable wear-out age.

*Pattern D* shows low failure probability when the item is new or just
out of shop, then a rapid increase to a constant level.

Pattern E shows a constant probability of failure at all ages (random
failure).

*Pattern F* starts with high infant mortality, which drops eventually to
a constant or very slowly increasing failure probability.

In highly complex equipment, such as an aircraft, infant mortality
followed by random failure is the dominating failure pattern as shown by
the above studies carried out on civil aircraft. Within manufacturing
industry, approximately 30% of industrial failures are related to age as
in A & B. With increasing complexity of modern equipment the failure
pattern from industry will more closely match the studies from the
aircraft industry.

### 7. <span id="anchor-49"></span>7. The Nature of Failure      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

Failure pattern B depicts age-related failures as in the figures from
the aircraft industry very few failures show a relation-ship with age.
An example would be abrasion, e.g. the abrasive action of piston rings
on the cylinder walls of a reciprocating engine.

Failure pattern C shows a steadily increasing probability of failure,
but there is no one point at which we can say, "that's where it wears
out". Cyclic stresses resulting in fatigue are the main cause of this
failure pattern.

Failure Pattern E is pure random failure. All the empirical evidence
shows that rolling element bearings usually conform to a random failure
pattern. However it is still possible to compute a mean time between
failure (MTBF) for such items. It is given as the point at which 63% of
the items have failed. Often poor MTBF for bearings can be attributed to
poor choice and/or fitting.

Failure pattern F is the most common failure pattern and like the bath
curve shows a failure rate decreasing with age before going into a
period of random failure. The high infant mortality has a variety of
causes:

poor design bad workmanship

incorrect installation poor reassemble

incorrect commissioning incorrect operation

invasive maintenance poor quality manufacture

unnecessary routine maintenance cleanliness

### <span id="anchor-50"></span>8. <span id="anchor-51"></span><span id="anchor-50"></span>8. Bell Curve      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Failure Theory Index](#Section2) \] 

Some engineers and managers tend to be over optimistic about the
effectiveness of Planned Maintenance (PM). There are limitations to PM:

-   the limitations set by random failure events. Random machinery
    failure events, according to their definition, could occur with
    equal probability in time. Identical components could be as likely
    to fail after 1 week as 5 years after installation. In effect, they
    are always as good as new. There is no period of time after which it
    would be effective to change these components.
-   the life dispersion of machinery components. Even time dependent
    failures are not all that predictable. They do not appear after
    absolutely equal operating intervals, but after very dissimilar time
    periods (Figure 12). This dispersion increases as the
    MTBF increases.

The example below (failure distribution A) shows the occurrence of MTBF
for a compressor bearing:

10 bearings failed between 2.5 years and 3.5 years.

20 bearings failed between 3.5 years and 4.5 years, etc.

From 3.25 years the incident of bearing failure started to increase

By 5.5 years 50% of the bearings had failed

Some bearings did not fail until 8.5 years

Imagine a strategy of changing all the bearings at 4.7 years.

The frequency of failure had started to increase over a year earlier and
some bearings would continue to run satisfactorily for another 3.7
years. Even though this planned maintenance is 0.8 years before the
average life of 5.5 years, a considerable number of failures still occur
(area a + b).

This planned maintenance is expensive in that it changes the majority of
bearings needlessly early (up to 3.7 years early) and it does not
prevent failures as a small amount still occurs.

Planned maintenance for failure distribution "B" in which the majority
of failures occur in the period 4.3 years to 7 years would be more
effective. A PM strategy at 4.7 years would allow a small number of
failures (area b). It again takes place 0.8 years before the average and
2 years before the maximum expected life. While in this case it is more
suitable for PM than distribution "A", it still incurs costs due to
early maintenance. Distribution A type curves would be more usual in
industry than distribution B. For failure distribution "B" and possibly
"A" Condition Based Maintenance would be suitable.

<span id="anchor-55"></span>**Figure 13 Maintenance Strategies**     \[

Index](#_Toc404048871) \]

### <span id="anchor-56"></span>9.1. Introduction      \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

Once equipment has been purchased it must be maintained. The decisions
made at the purchasing will have an input into the type of maintenance
to be carried out. Maintenance actions can be divided into four general
categories or strategies as shown in Figure 13. The maintenance plan for
a company's assets will be a combination of these four strategies, often
they could all be used on the same machine.

### <span id="anchor-57"></span>9.2. On-Failure Maintenance      \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

On failure maintenance can be effective if applied correctly. For
example, non-critical low cost equipment, or where no other strategy is
possible

**Advantages**

Low cost if correctly applied

Requires no advanced planning other than ensuring spares are available

**Disadvantages**

No warning of failure - safety risk

Uncontrolled plant outage - production losses

Requires large standby maintenance team

Secondary damage - longer repair time

Large spares stock requirement

Provision of standby plant

### <span id="anchor-58"></span>9.3. Fixed Time (Planned) Maintenance        \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

Planned maintenance is the most widely used form of maintenance. It is
most effective if implemented as equipment begins to wearout and failure
probability increases. Planned maintenance tasks are often grouped
together into maintenance downtimes or windows to minimise the total
number of planned maintenance stoppages per year. This strategy is
seriously flawed because the majority of industrial failure modes are
random in nature and so maintenance tasks based on time will have
limited effected in improving equipment performance.

**Advantages**

Failures reduced

Labour used cost-effectively

Maintenance planned well in advance (provision for labour and material)

**Disadvantages**

Maintenance activity and costs increased

Unnecessary and invasive maintenance is carried out

Applicable only to age related deterioration

Maintenance sometimes induces failures (infant mortality)

### <span id="anchor-59"></span>9.4. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM)      \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

CBM relies on the fact that the majority of failures do not occur
instantaneously but develop over a period of time (P-F Curve). CBM
involves recording some measurement that gives an indication of machine
condition (temperature increase on an insulation surface, vibration
increase on a bearing housing). Condition monitoring is not purely a
***'high tech'*** tool to be used by highly skilled engineers. From the
early days of steam trains "wheel tappers" used a hammer to strike a
wheel to listen for the distinctive "ring" that said the wheel is
healthy and without cracks. Operators who work with equipment every day
can listen to equipment and identify changes in noise levels and
vibrations. Temperature changes can be felt and these give warnings that
something is 'not right'. An investigation can then be carried out to
identify the exact problem.

**Advantages**

Maximises equipment availability

Some forms of inspection utilising human senses can be inexpensive

Allows shutdown before severe damage occurs

Production can be modified to extend unit life

Cause of failure can be analysed

Maintenance can be planned;

Labour can be organised

Spares can be assembled

**Disadvantages**

Vibration monitoring, Thermograph and Oil Debris Analysis require
specialised equipment and training. A company must carefully choose the
correct technique. A period of time will be required for trends to
develop and then machine condition can be assessed.

### <span id="anchor-60"></span>9.5. Design out      \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

This can prove to be a very effective method of solving a recurring
problem. However it can easily be inappropriately utilised. Putting in a
more powerful motor due to frequent tripping may be an ill-thought out
reaction to malpractice by an operator, whilst simple instruction may
solve the same problem. Before considering designing out a problem, it
is important to identify exactly what the root cause of the problem is.
Having identified the root cause; is it possible to monitor the
condition at this problem area? If so, it may be cost effective to
monitor the condition and take action as necessary. If this is not the
case; can the problem be designed out? If it can; what will this involve
and can it have any adverse effects elsewhere? Once the procedure has
been thoroughly developed, proceed with the design out project. Finally
if design out is been considered, is it a symptom that mistakes were
made during the original designing of the equipment?

**Advantages**

Some minor design out projects can be inexpensive and guaranteed to work

A recurring problem can be completely resolved

**Disadvantages**

The root cause of the problem may get missed in the exercise

Larger design out projects can prove to be very expensive.

Production can be disrupted for a considerable period of time with
larger projects

The expected result may not materialise

Unexpected problems may occur as a result of a major project

Solving a problem in one area may overload and cause problems in
another.

### <span id="anchor-61"></span>9.6. Opportunity Maintenance       \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

This in not actually a maintenance strategy but a combination of fixed
time (planned maintenance) and breakdown maintenance. It can be useful
when a forced stoppage gives maintenance unexpected access to machinery
to carry out inspections and/or maintenance. Inspections during routine
down times can identify unexpected tasks that need to be carried out but
time does not allow it to happen. These tasks can be recorded on a
maintenance management system and scheduled into the first available
down time.

<span id="anchor-62"></span>10. <span id="anchor-63"></span><span id="anchor-62"></span>10. Potential Failures and the P-F Curve  \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \] 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With a growing awareness of the random nature of many failures,
condition monitoring techniques are becoming more popular. Modern
condition based maintenance practices like vibration analysis rely on
the fact that many failures do not occur instantaneously, but actually
develop over a period of time. If evidence can be found that this
failure process is under way, it may be possible to take action to
prevent failure and/or avoid the consequences. At the early stages of
failure it is not possible to detect the signs of an impending failure.
As the failure develops, there comes a point at which it can be
measured. At this stage the failure has not yet reached a stage in which
the equipment is unable to operate effectively. However the maintenance
department has now the opportunity to correct the fault, before it
becomes more serious. The point in the failing process at which it is
possible to detect that the failure is occurring or is about to occur is
known as a *potential failure* (potential because a serious failure has
not yet occurred). Examples include:

-   hot spots on bearing housings and in electrical panels.
-   vibrations indicating imminent bearing failure
-   particles in gearbox oil showing imminent gear failure
-   visible leaks and wear.

The P-F curve (Figure 14) shows how a failure starts, deteriorates to
the point at which it can be detected (the potential failure point "P"),
if it is not detected and corrected, continues to deteriorate - usually
at an accelerating rate - until it reaches the point of functional
failure ('F') The P-F interval can be known as the "Lead Time To
Failure."

<span id="anchor-64"></span>**Figure 14 the P-F Curve showing inspection
intervals**      \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]     \[
[Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \]

The "condition" being measured can take a variety of forms. Any
condition that shows a change, as the health of the spare deteriorates,
can be used. It must however, give enough of a warning between "P" and
"F" to allow actions to take place otherwise nothing will be gained by
having a warning. Equipment condition being measured could include:

-   reducing pressure supplied by a pump indicating impeller wear, slip
    ring wear, etc.
-   increased surface temperature on the outside of an insulating
    surface indicating insulation deteriorating
-   increased vibration from rotating equipment; these vibrations must
    be analysed further to identify possible causes.

Having identified point P then two actions can take place:

*to prevent the functional failure*. Depending on the nature of the
failure mechanism, it is sometimes possible to intervene to repair the
existing component before it fails completely.

*to avoid the consequences of the failure.* In most cases, detecting a
potential failure does not actually prevent the spare from failing, but
still makes it possible to avoid or reduce the consequences of the
failure. For example the necessary spares, personnel and equipment could
be made available, or the effected part could be changed out of
production time before it actually fails.

<span id="anchor-65"></span>11. <span id="anchor-66"></span><span id="anchor-65"></span>11. P-F Curves and inspection interval timing      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \] 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The life of a component and the P-F curve are often confused.
On-condition task frequencies are often based on the real or imagined
"life" of the item. If it exists at all, this life is usually many times
greater than the P-F interval, so the task achieves little or nothing.
The component life is measured forward from the moment it enters
service. On the other hand the P-F interval is measured back from the
functional failure to some point that a warning of the forthcoming
function failure can be detected (potential failure). The two concepts
are often unrelated.

<span id="anchor-67"></span>**Figure 15 P-F curve and inspection
interval timing**        \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]     \[
[Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \]

In the above example (Figure 15), the batch of components has a random
failure pattern with two failures in the first year. Let us assume that
over a large batch these components have an average life of 3 years.
From condition monitoring it has been observed that these components
have a P-F interval of about 4 months. Because they started to fail in
the first year of service the condition monitoring tasks must commence
immediately after installation on a 2 monthly basis. The timing of the
inspections has nothing to do with the age or life of the component.

P-F curves can have considerable variation in length from minutes to
months. A P-F curve of 4 months is desired because:

-   fewer on-condition inspections are required
-   there is more time to organise the people and materials needed to
    correct the potential failure
-   it is easier to plan to correct the potential failure without
    disrupting operations or other maintenance activities
-   it is possible to do whatever is necessary to avoid the consequences
    of the failure in a more considered and hence more
    controlled fashion.

<span id="anchor-68"></span>12. <span id="anchor-69"></span><span id="anchor-68"></span>12. Condition based maintenance (CBM) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="anchor-70"></span>12.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]      \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

Earlier it was shown that due to the randomness of many failure modes,
planned maintenance (based on time elapsed, machine running time,
machine cycles, etc.) will have limited effected on improving the
performance machinery. Often it can actually make it worse. In many
situations it can prove cost effective to measure the condition of the
equipment and plan maintenance as required. This is known as condition
based maintenance (CBM).

### <span id="anchor-71"></span>12.2. Operating Parameters 

How best to monitor machine or bearing condition requires one to know
which measurements to take and where and how to take them. Commonly
measured operating parameters include:

### <span id="anchor-72"></span>12.2.1. Vibration 

In rolling element bearings, vibration results from the impact generated
by a ball rolling over a defect. Methods such as Shock Pulse and Spike
Energy are used to detect bearing damage. Vibration measurements taken
and trended over time can be a good indication of bearing damage.
Vibration is the best operating parameter to judge rotating machinery
conditions such as balance, alignment, bearing stability, and stress
applied to components. Measuring the overall vibration of a machine; a
rotor in relation to a machine; or the structure of a machine, and
comparing the measurement to its normal value (baseline reading) and
alarm setpoints, indicates the current health of the machine.

### 12.2.2. <span id="anchor-73"></span>12.2.2. Temperature 

Temperature measurement (Thermograph) is a useful indicator of
electrical or mechanical condition such as the load applied to a thrust
bearing. As a bearing fails, friction causes its temperature to rise.
The use of infrared cameras or installing thermocouple sensors in the
housing of a bearing and measuring temperature changes within the
bearing or lubricant allows problems to be recognised early (potential
failure).

### 12.2.3. <span id="anchor-74"></span>12.2.3. Lubricating Oil Analysis 

Monitoring oil condition warns of an increase in foreign substances,
such as water, (&gt;2.5%) which can degrade the lubricating properties
of the oil and cause bearing failures. It also detects the presence of
metallic particles carried into the oil stream. These metallic particles
are analysed to determine which part of the machine is wearing and how
fast. Particle Counting and Ferrograph are two analysis techniques.

### <span id="anchor-75"></span>12.2.4. Acoustics 

Very high frequency, acoustically transmitted vibration is measured with
a high frequency piezoelectric sensor. This sensor is excited by
compression waves produced by metal-to-metal contact and by metal as it
mechanically fails. The acoustic flow detection signal is conditioned to
produce outputs which can be measured as numerical values on a meter.
These measurements are used to judge the overall condition of a bearing
and evaluate local defects. This technique is highly effective in very
early detection of bearing failure.

### <span id="anchor-76"></span>12.2.5. The Human Senses 

The simplest condition monitoring techniques are the four human senses
(look, listen, feel, and smell)

Machinery faults such as:

-   visible wear on slides.
-   vibration levels from rotating equipment
-   damage on conveyor belts, drive belts.
-   tension adjustment on belts, drive chains.
-   oil, water levels.
-   pressure and other types of gauges can be monitored
-   heat build-up on bearing housings refractory linings, etc.

They are not as accurate as the more scientific methods but still have
considerable advantages:

-   A human being is versatile and can detect a wide variety of failure
    conditions, (an infrared camera can only detect heat)
-   Operators are always near the equipment so if a P-F curve is very
    short, an operator can check specified measurement points many times
    a shift if necessary. The only alternative in the case of very short
    P-F curves is highly expensive on-line monitoring equipment.

Many of these monitoring tasks are ideal for operators due to their
close proximity to equipment. Skilled maintenance engineers may not be
always available to carry out these tasks and would prefer to be doing
more highly skilled jobs.

### <span id="anchor-77"></span>12.2.6. Other Parameters 

Information available in a machine's control system such as pressure,
flow, and speed, or from machinery gauges can be incorporated into a
condition monitoring program for assessment and historical trending.

<span id="anchor-79"></span>13. Vibration Analysis 
---------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="anchor-80"></span>13.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]     \[ [Implementation Index](#_Toc404048871) \] 

Different machinery problems cause different types of vibration. For
example, a bent shaft causes a machine to vibrate differently to a worn
bearing. Generally, these differences are indistinguishable to the touch
or ear. However, with sensors and micro-processors, some condition
monitoring equipment coverts' vibration data into various plotted
formats that are recorded and analysed to help diagnose machinery
problems. Vibration analysis is the analysis of these plotted vibration
signals to diagnose the cause(s) of abnormal vibration. Popular
vibration analysis formats include overall vibration trend plots, time
waveforms, spectra analysis and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

<span id="anchor-81"></span>13.2. CBM Tours 
--------------------------------------------

Condition Based Maintenance utilising vibration analysis involves
setting up "tours" (a list of condition based maintenance tasks to be
carried out). One particular tour may take place every two months. The
measurements taken on this tour can be recorded using a data collector
and trended in a maintenance management package with automatic alarm
signals if increases in vibration signatures are recorded. The vibration
measurement at each measurement point will vary dependent on the type of
failure mode being trended.

<span id="anchor-82"></span>13.3. Overall Vibration 
----------------------------------------------------

Overall vibration measures the total energy associated with all
vibration frequencies coming from a given measurement point. Overall
vibration values are compared to past vibration measurements taken when
the machine was in good running order.

<span id="anchor-83"></span>13.4. Fast Fourier Transform 
---------------------------------------------------------

Because different types of problems often occur at different frequencies
it is very useful to analyse measured vibration signals with respect to
frequency. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can mathematically breakdown
the overall vibration signal and arrange it according to frequency. The
amount of vibration occurring at any particular frequency is called the
*amplitude *of vibration at that frequency. FFT analysis can be very
useful when analysing the causes of vibration. Vibration associated with
say a bent shaft or impeller problem will occur with the frequency of
rotation of the shaft. Problems associated with the roller bearings will
occur at higher frequencies that are a function of the number of rollers
in a bearing.

<span id="anchor-84"></span>13.5. Failure Modes 
------------------------------------------------

A selection of common detectable failure modes are:

*Imbalance:* a peak at shaft speed.

*Misalignment*: typically 1x, 2x & 3x shaft speed

*Looseness*: often at 1x or 2x shaft speed

*Bearing Damage*: higher frequency peaks typically between 2 KHz and 5
KHz depending on shaft speed and transducer resonance.

*Electrical Problems*: synchronous frequency and side bands.

*Gear Damage*: gear mesh frequency depending on shaft speed and number
of teeth and side bands.

*Oil Whirl*: approximately half shaft speed.

*Blade Damage*: number of blades by shaft speed.

*Cracked Shaft*: typically 2x, 3x shaft speed.

<span id="anchor-87"></span>14. Plant Register (Asset Hierarchy) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="anchor-88"></span>14.1. Introduction        \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

Most organisations use, hundreds, if not thousands of physical assets.
The assets range in size from small pumps to steel rolling mills. They
may be concentrated on one small site, or spread over thousands of
square kilometres. The number and variety of items means that it is
necessary to draw up a comprehensive list of these assets for
maintenance purposes, spares purchasing, or accounting exercises. In
maintaining equipment it must be possibly to identify individual spares
and the effect of their failure on the total plant This list is known as
the plant register The plant register is a listing of the plant,
equipment and buildings owned or used by the organisation, which can
require maintenance of any sort. In establishing a plant register a
structured *(or hierarchical) *approach to asset definition is required.

### <span id="anchor-89"></span>14.2. Hierarchy    \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

Five terms must be defined

Spares (& Measurement Points), Item, Unit, Area & Plant

**Spare: **This is the lowest inventory level and is where the spare
parts are found. Examples include, seals and bearings. All maintenance
actions are carried out at the spare level. When a gearbox fails it will
be gears, bearings, seals or shafts that will fail. Vibration analysis
assesses the condition of individual bearings. In recording maintenance
tasks, they must be attributed to a spare. This enables historical
analysis to be carried out in an FMEA and problem areas on machines can
be identified from their Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time
To Repair (MTTR).

**Mpoint & Parameter** In many cases, an FMEA will lead to routing
condition monitoring tasks. These tasks can vary from a machine operator
checking the fluid level in a site glass to specialist contractors
carrying out crack detection tests on turbines. Regardless of what type
of inspection is being carried out, some parameter is being measured.
For this parameter a pass and fail standard must exist for comparison
purposes. For some parameters such as vibration the positioning of the
test probe is critical for continuity of measurement. In these cases a
measurement point (Mpoint) will be specified.

**Item: **An item is a collection of spare parts, For example a gearbox
may consist of shafts, bearings and seals. Often items can be replaced -
a gearbox or motor can be exchanged for another item to carry out the
same task.

**Unit: **A number of items may be grouped together to perform a
specific function. A motor, gearbox, belt & rollers, together with a
frame will build up to form a belt conveyor.

**Area: **A number of units such as conveyors, weighing machines and
packaging machines will build up to form an area of plant that performs
a specific function, i.e. packing area.

**Plant: **A number of areas will make up an entire plant e.g.
ingredient mixing area, ovens, cooling area, and packaging area. Often a
plant will be a single cost centre.

Creating an asset hierarchy is a time consuming and complex task. This
can be highlighted by the case of a water pump.

A main water pump in a hydro-electric station would be an area on its
own because three levels would be required below the pump level to
describe all of the valves and hydraulic control gear needed to control
the water flow.

In industry most motor/pumping units with associated valves and switch
gear would be considered as a unit. The motor and pump would be
considered as items.

A motor/pump unit in a central heating system would not be serviced. In
the hierarchy it could be treated as a spare.

Creating classifications may not be a simple task. In industry the
hierarchy may be based on stages of the process. In building services
the classification may be based on location. Problems can arise when
both may be applicable but they conflict.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="anchor-92"></span>15.1. Introduction       \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]  \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

FMEA & FMECA (Ref. ) are engineering analysis that, if performed
properly, can be of great value in assisting the decision making process
of the engineer during the design stage or maintenance review to
analysis possible and existing modes of failures of a piece of
equipment. The analysis is often called a 'bottom up' analysis as it
examines equipment at the spare level, and considers the system failures
that result from their different failure modes. In an FMECA analysis a
relative criticality is calculated for each failure mode.

### <span id="anchor-93"></span>15.2. Benefits     \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

-   It provides designers and maintenance engineers with an
    understanding of the structure of the system, and the factors which
    influence reliability.
-   It helps to identify items that are reliability sensitive or of high
    risk, and so gives a means of deciding priorities for
    corrective action.
-   It identifies where special effort is needed during manufacture,
    assembly or maintenance.
-   It establishes if there are any operational constraints resulting
    from the design.
-   It gives assurance to management and/or customers that reliability
    is being or has been properly addressed in the project.

A good FME(C)A will present in tabular form for each failure mode of all
the components:

-   The effect on sub-assemble, assembly, sub-system etc. to system
    level;
-   likelihood of occurrence;
-   severity and criticality (for a criticality analysis).

The report may also include further information, such as recommendations
for:

manufacture and assembly (inspection, test, quality of components etc.);

maintenance (inspection, test, replacement periods etc.);

detectability (user, maintainer, etc.).

### <span id="anchor-94"></span>15.3. Maintenance Review      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

A maintenance review can be carried out using an FMECA approach to
identify potential failure modes. This is done by gathering the
maintenance records of the plant. Accurately recorded data obviously
aids the production of an optimised maintenance plan. It is here that
the benefit of associating all maintenance tasks to a particular spare
becomes crucial to an accurate review. The findings from the FMECA are
then tabulated in the form of a work sheet. A FMECA worksheet with
typical columns is shown in Figure 18.

<span id="anchor-96"></span>16. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) 
----------------------------------------------------------

<span id="anchor-97"></span>\[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[
[Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \]

Fault Tree Analysis can be a very detailed process and is used in the
analysis of complex systems. It complements FMECA in that it is a
"top-down" analysis, starting with a system fault (the top event) and
analysing this fault in terms of sub-system faults. For example in the
nuclear industry the top event could be a leak of radio-active water
from a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is then analysed to identify
every possible way it could leak such as a leaking flange or cracked
pipe. Each sub event is then analysed to identify how each one could
occur, such as incorrect flange packing fitted, incorrect flange
pressure, excessive water pressure, etc. One of the next levels would
then be to identify all possible reasons for a pressure build up inside
the heat exchanger pipes. The process is complete when every possible
root cause of a water leak form the heat exchanger has been identified.
Each event can have a probability associated to it. The same techniques
as used in the chapter on Reliability Block Diagrams can then be used to
estimate the probability of a radio-active leak form the heat exchanger.

**Example**

In Figure 19 the top event is no liquid display on a calculator. This
can be caused either because the LCD has failed, or because there is no
power reaching the display. The latter fault is analysed further, and
may be caused by the faults shown, either switch failed at off, or
internal wiring failure, or no power to the calculator.

In this example the secondary basic events of:

Multiple failure of LCD's

Battery uncharged

No battery

will not be investigated because it does not really matter why the
battery is uncharged or why the battery is missing.

The secondary basic events of:

Internal wiring or joint failure in the calculator

Wiring or joint failure in transformer could be investigated if desired.
However it may be easier to replace the transformer or calculator than
try to fix them.

Fault trees utilise many different symbols, some similar to digital
electronics e.g. AND gates (in which all of the inputs must occur
together for the event to operate) & OR Gates (in which only one of the
events must occur for the event to operate).

<span id="anchor-99"></span>17. Cause and Effect Diagrams (Fish Bone or Ishikawa Diagrams) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance
Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \]

Fish bone diagrams are another graphical method of listing causes of an
event. "The Top Event" is shown at the end of a horizontal line on the
right of the diagram. The major categories of possible causes are
arranged as branches slanting off above and below this line. Typical
causes of the top event include the four "M's" - man, methods,
materials, and machines. Specific possible causes become the detailed
twigs as shown in Figure 19.

***Maintenance Practices & Procedures***

Poor workmanship (*man*) can result in some of the errors such as
misalignment. Errors such as impeller balance may result from material
(*materials*) build up on the impeller.

***Equipment Design***

The basic design of the machine (*machine*) may be deficient such as a
seal design will not protect the lubricating oil from water
contamination.

***Operating Practices***

The system design may cause errors such as cavation. Inappropriate
operating procedures (*methods*) such as frequent stop starts may result
in early machine failure.

The fish bone diagram helps to focus one's mind on the possible causes
of equipment failure. Maintenance should look to cure the cause and not
the symptoms of the problem. For this reason causes should be pushed as
far back as possible. Each possible cause must then be analysed using
techniques such as FMECA to analyse the exact cause of failure.

### <span id="anchor-102"></span>18.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

RCM grew from studies carried out during the development of the Boeing
747 (Ref. <span id="anchor-103"></span>RCM grew from studies carried out
during the development of the Boeing 747 (Ref. ). This work showed that
the failure modes of aircraft components are random dominated. At this
time aircraft maintenance was based predominately on flying hours,
therefore, a new method of maintaining aircraft was considered
appropriate. The RCM approach assumes no prior knowledge of the
components, a so-called ***zero-based*** or ***first principles***
approach. Each component in the aircraft was systematically analysed to
identify their failure modes and appropriate maintenance tasks were then
assigned. This analysis is carried out by asking seven questions about
each asset.

### <span id="anchor-104"></span>18.2. Seven Basic Questions  \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

**1 What are the functions and associated performance standards of the
asset in its present operating context?**

Functions are categorised as follows:

*On Line Functions* that are in use continuously or at such frequency
that personnel will be continuously aware of their state.

*Standby Functions* that are under the supervision of operations
personnel but are used so infrequently that a special check is required
to identify (hidden) failures that have occurred.

**2 In what ways does it fail to fulfil its functions (failure mode)?**

The failure modes to be considered are:

1.  Failures that have previously occurred on the equipment or
    similar machines.
2.  Possible failures that have not occurred before but could have
    serious consequences.
3.  Failure modes for which preventive maintenance has already been
    applied in order to prevent failure.

**3 What causes each failure?**

Each potential failure must be investigated to identify every possible
cause. Maintenance actions are then put in place to tackle the causes
and not the symptoms of a failure. This stage of RCM must be controlled
as time can be wasted investigating unlikely causes of failure.

**4 What happens when each functional failure occurs?**

It is necessary to understand the consequences of each functional
failure to determine if any preventative maintenance is actually
required.

**5 In what way does each failure matter?**

Once the failure consequences have been identified, they are
categorised, which will aid in the determination of an appropriate
maintenance task.

**6 What can be done to prevent each failure**

The characteristics of the individual failure mode will determine which
one of the four maintenance strategies will be chosen

**7 What should be done if a suitable preventative task cannot be found.
(default tasks*****)***

An obvious maintenance task may not exist for some failure modes. RCM
provides a detailed decision tree to ensure the correct type of
maintenance task is selected for each failure mode.

### <span id="anchor-105"></span>18.3. Implementing RCM      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \] 

RCM can be implemented through the setting up of cross-section review
groups who will work through the above 'seven questions' to develop the
maintenance requirements for specified assets. The zero-based approach
necessitates a high degree of understanding of the asset being analysed.
If the necessary skills do not exist within the company external
specialists may be invited to join the group to discuss specific problem
areas. Each review group will be chaired by a facilitator who will
control the flow of information, ensuring it is recorded on specific RCM
worksheets. The group will work together to answer the first four of the
'seven questions'. The RCM Information Worksheets are used to record the
answers to these questions:

-   Function of the asset
-   Functional failure
-   Failure mode
-   Failure effect

The next stage of RCM considers the final three of the 'seven questions'
to evaluate the consequences of the failures and based on the
consequences, identify appropriated maintenance tasks. The RCM Decision
Tree is used in this task. The output from the groups will be RCM
Decision Worksheets detailing:

-   Item or component
-   Proposed task
-   Periodicity
-   Trade

It is then the responsibility of maintenance and production management
to introduce these revised tasks to the factory floor employees.

### <span id="anchor-108"></span>19.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

The introduction of a comprehensive preventive maintenance program based
on a thorough review of the operation and maintenance of the plant is
essential to achieve competitive production. An effective method of
carrying out a maintenance review is to use as a base line the
experience of the plant that has been built into the existing
maintenance program and maintenance history rather than the 'zero-based'
approach of Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM). To carry out an
effective review, it must be carried out in two stages:

### <span id="anchor-109"></span>19.2. Reliability and Criticality Analysis    \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

A structured analysis of plant criticality (in terms of downtime,
safety, quality etc.) is performed through the use of Reliability Block
Diagram modelling of the process derived from process flow diagrams This
results in a prioritised list of equipment for targeting in the next
stage.

### <span id="anchor-110"></span>19.3. Maintenance Review        \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

The optimum maintenance tasks for the targeted equipment are derived
through a failure mode orientated (FMECA) review of existing maintenance
programs and history. The FMECA can be carried out by reviewing the
plant maintenance history and speaking to plant production and
maintenance personnel using techniques such as Why-Why analysis (5
Whys).

### <span id="anchor-111"></span>19.4. Maintenance Tasks       \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

This process will lead to specified maintenance tasks for each failure
mode identified. The selected maintenance strategies for the individual
modes of failure will in general comprise, Design-out, Condition
Monitoring, Fixed Time (planned) Maintenance, and Opportunity
Maintenance. Some items may also be allowed to run to failure. In
assembling the plan for the plant, maintenance resources and production
windows will have a major influence on the maintenance program for the
whole plant. The process of assembling the plan will inevitably involve
change in strategies and interactive approach to obtain the optimum
balance between ideal maintenance strategy, production constraints and
maintenance resources. Figure 21 graphically represents the procedure
for carrying out a review of equipment maintenance (REM).

<span id="anchor-112"></span>20. <span id="anchor-113"></span><span id="anchor-112"></span>20. Why-Why Analysis 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="anchor-114"></span>20.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

Many companies will contain information about historical plant
performance in a variety of sources such as maintenance records and
production records. This information can be useful in identifying the
significant failure modes within the plant which can then be targeted by
revised maintenance tasks. The targeting of these failure modes will
realise the maximum improvement in plant performance for the least
expenditure. However in many companies the paper based or computerised
records will not contain the required detail to enable the significant
failure modes to be identified. MMSs and daily production records may
also record the same problem but it may be difficult to collate them
together for various reasons.

### <span id="anchor-115"></span>20.2. Maintenance & Production Records       \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

The down time on the daily production log would be the total time the machine was stopped. The down time on the MMS may be the time the engineer was in attendance, which may be considerably shorter. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Production personnel are often not technically minded and may put
    the warning effect down as the cause of failure, which may bare no
    resemblance to the engineers' description of the same failure.
2.  The location of the failure may vary considerably. Production
    operators may use different descriptions for machinery from the
    maintenance department. The warning effect, as described by the
    production operators may occur in a different location to the actual
    mode of failure as described by the maintenance department.
3.  One department may be deliberately incorrectly describing a problem
    in-order to pass the blame to the other department.
4.  Some breakdowns, for example product blockages, may not require the
    assistance of an engineer. Operators may accept these problems as
    the norm and therefore not adequately record the details of
    the delay.

For these reasons it is vitally important to analyse fully the available
maintenance records. By asking why, four or five times the interviewee
may be moved from using the warning effect as the mode of failure to
describing the mode of failure itself.

### <span id="anchor-116"></span>20.3. Example of Why Why      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]   \[ [Maintenance Optimisation Index](#_Toc404045794) \] 

In the following example, fourteen biscuits are collated by the counting
machine and then presented to the flow wrapper to be wrapped. The pack
collator then arranges three packs of fourteen biscuits together to be
passed to the cartoning machine which puts the three packs into a
carton.

**Why** was the carton forming machine rejecting so many packs of cakes
due to short pack counts in multipacks?

Poor performance by the collator results in it being unable to count and
collate the required number of packs to be fed into the cartoner.

**Why** was the smart feeder unable to collate the packs correctly?

The collator has difficulty in counting packs due to pack length
variation. Broken biscuits along with poor quality seals results in
contamination of the drive conveyors.

**Why** are the packs varying in length, and why are the seals of poor
quality?

Poorly arranged packs of biscuits by the counting machine are been being
crushed by the cross seals of the flow wrapper resulting in contaminated
jaws and poor seals. Operators adjust the pack length to stop this
happening.

**Why** are the packs of biscuits poorly arranged?

The cakes are held loosely because there are short cake counts in the
packs.

**Why** is there short cake counts in the packs?

Because of various problems in the counting machine, cakes are being
dropped.

In order to stop the carton former rejecting packs of cakes due to short
pack counts in multipacks, it is necessary to concentrate the
maintenance actions on a machine upstream of the cartoning machine. A
review of the performance of the counting machine recommended a range of
actions to improve its performance.

### <span id="anchor-119"></span>21.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

Maintaining equipment involves the collection of large amounts of
information to record historical equipment performance, identify spares,
etc. Historically this information has been held in paper based records.
Large amounts of paper based records can become difficult and expensive
to store and analyse, errors and omissions can then easily take place.
The development of the Personnel Computer has been followed by an
increasing choice of computerised Maintenance Management Systems (MMS)
which replaced the paper based records. MMS should perform functions
such as:

### <span id="anchor-120"></span>21.2. Asset Manager      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

This example gives assess to the plant inventory . This is a multi-level
hierarchical filing system using seven levels:

P   Plant - Major system

A   Area - Sub division of a plant

U   Unit - Individual functional items of equipment

I    Item - Sub assembly - highest sub division for in-situ repair or
replacement

S   Spare - Component that would be replaced on failure

The next two levels are used specifically in the condition based
maintenance function (CBM Manager)

M    Measurement Point - where is the measurement to be taken?

F     Fault Parameter - with details of the measurement to be made to
detect the fault

### <span id="anchor-121"></span>21.3. CBM Manager     \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

The CBM Manager is used to generate routine inspections. This module
includes the functionally required to organise, take measurements and
review trends and vibration spectra associated with condition based
maintenance. These cbm tasks such as vibration analysis can be taken

The Spares Manager provides a stores and purchasing management system
integrated with both the Asset Manager and Work Control systems.

### <span id="anchor-123"></span>21.5. Work Control Manager       \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

This module is used to generate and record details of planned
maintenance tasks. The Work Control Manager specifies the following
information to be recorded against each maintenance task Figure 22).

**Asset identification** using the asset hierarchy

**Asset Type**, e.g. boiler, pump, motor.

**Fault codes: **The asset type will have a number of Fault Codes
associated with it - e.g. excess vibration, will not start, monthly PM
check.

**Asset code** will be based on the asset hierarchy.

**Expense codes** can be used to define the type of cost being allocated
to a job - e.g. mechanical labour, mechanical spares.

**Job types **define job categories, e.g. breakdown, preventative
maintenance.

**Priority codes** are used to assist with prioritisation of work - e.g.
IMMEDIATE must be done within one hour.

**Skill** level of the person to carry out task - e.g. fitter,
electrician, operator

<span id="anchor-126"></span>22. <span id="anchor-127"></span><span id="anchor-126"></span>22. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span id="anchor-128"></span>22.1. Introduction      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

The section on reliability has discussed estimating and measuring
equipment reliability to perform its intended function without failure.
Often companies are very good at recording the level of equipment
breakdown. However this is only one of five reasons why equipment is not
performing up to the expected standards; availability is effected by
*down time*; capacity lost is effected by *speed losses*; and yield is
effected by *defect losses*. In order to get the maximum performance or
OEE from equipment the "six big losses" must be eliminated:

### <span id="anchor-129"></span>22.2. Six big losses      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

*Down Time:*

Equipment failure - from breakdowns

Set-up and adjustment - changeovers

*Speed Losses:*

Idling and minor stoppages - due to the abnormal operation of sensors,
blockages, contamination, etc.

Reduced speed - due to discrepancies between the design and actual speed
of equipment (capacity derating over time).

*Defect:*

Process defects - due to scraps and quality defects to be repaired

Reduced yield - from machine start-up to stable production (following a
batch change over or a shutdown).

### 22.3. <span id="anchor-130"></span>22.3. Availability      \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]    \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

It is necessary to define some terms.

*Planned downtime*, is the amount of time officially scheduled in the
production plan, which includes, no orders, changeovers and planned
maintenance.

*Loading Time*, or the available time is derived by subtracting the
planned downtime from the available time per day or week, etc.

Availability = *Operating time*

Loading time

= *Loading Time -Down Time*

Loading Time

### <span id="anchor-131"></span>22.4. Performance Efficiency \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \]  \[ [Maintenance Performance Index](#_Toc404493991) \] 

*Performance efficiency* is the product of the operating speed rate and
the net operating rate. The *operating speed rate* refers to the
discrepancy between the ideal speed (based on equipment capacity as
designed) and its actual speed.

Operating speed rate = *Theoretical Cycle Time. *

Actual Cycle Time.

Equipment may be deliberately run at a slower speed due to, faulty
equipment, quality problems etc.

The *net operating rate* measures the maintenance of a given speed over
a given period. This calculates losses resulting from minor recorded
stoppages, as well as those that go unrecorded on the daily log sheets.

Operating Time

Net operating time = *Actual Processing Time*

Operating Time

= *Processed Amount X Actual Cycle Time*

Operating Time

Performance Efficiency = Net Operating Time X Operating Speed Rate

= *Processed Amount X Actual Cycle Time.* X *Theoretical Cycle Time. *

Operating Time Actual Cycle Time.

= *Processed Amount X Theoretical Cycle Time. *

Operating Time.

### <span id="anchor-132"></span>22.5. Yield        \[ [go to Top of Page](#TopOfPage) \] 

Yield = *Process Amount - Defect Amount).*

Processed Amount

*OEE = Availability X Performance Efficiency X Yield*

Figure 23 gives an example calculation of OEE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For maintenance management purposes it may be desirable to graphically
represent historical maintenance data. This type of data can be
represented on histograms, pie-charts, etc. Another way of presenting
data is to carry out a Pareto Analysis. This tool can be applied to a
wide range of maintenance control problems, for example, to highlight
the relative importance of particular key plant registers to the total
maintenance effort on a line. The following histogram shows the
maintenance man-hours recorded against units numbers 1 to 30 in a 12
month period.

<span id="anchor-136"></span>**Figure 24 Man-Man Hours recorded against
each unit number**            \[ [Table of Figures](#TableFigures) \]

<span id="anchor-137"></span>**Figure 25 Pareto Analysis of Maintenance
Man-Hours recorded by unit**             \[ [Table of
Figures](#TableFigures) \]

The Pareto analysis shows that unit numbers 23, 1, 15, 23, 18, 14, 28,
6, 13, 17, 2 & 4 have incurred the majority of the maintenance
man-hours. The maximum benefit would be gained if these 12 units were
targeted to reduce their maintenance requirement.
